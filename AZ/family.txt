A. A child care group home shall be certified by the department. An application for a certificate shall be made on a written or electronic form prescribed by the department and shall contain all information required by the department.
B. If a child care group home is within one-fourth mile of agriculture land, the application shall include the names and addresses of the owners and lessees of any agricultural land within one-fourth mile of the facility. Within ten days after receipt of an application for a certificate, the department shall notify the owners and lessees of agricultural land as listed on the application. The department shall deny a certificate that affects agricultural land regulated pursuant to section 3-365, except that the owner of the agricultural land may agree to comply with the buffer zone requirements of section 3-365. If the owner agrees in writing to comply with the buffer zone requirements and records the agreement in the office of the county recorder as a restrictive covenant running with the title to the land, the department may issue a certificate to the child care group home to be located within the affected buffer zone. The agreement may include any stipulations regarding the child care group home, including conditions for future expansion of the facility and changes in the operational status of the facility that will result in a breach of the agreement. This subsection applies to the renewal of a certificate for a child care group home located in the same location if the child care group home certificate was not previously issued under this subsection.

D. Pursuant to available funding the department shall collect annual fees.
E. Beginning January 1, 2010, subject to the availability of monies, the department may establish a discount program for certification fees paid by child care group homes, including a public health discount program.
F. The department shall issue an initial certificate if the department determines that the applicant and the applicant's child care group home are in substantial compliance with the requirements of this article and department rules and the facility agrees to carry out a plan acceptable to the director to eliminate any deficiencies.
G. A certificate is valid unless it is revoked or suspended or the licensee does not pay the licensure fee and may be renewed by submitting the certification fee as prescribed by the department pursuant to subsection C of this
section.
H. In order to ensure that the equipment and services of a child care group home and the good character of
an applicant are conducive to the welfare of children, the department by rule shall establish the criteria for granting, denying, suspending and revoking a certificate.
I. The director shall adopt rules and prescribe forms as may be necessary for the proper administration and enforcement of this article.
