  For each child who is learning to use a toilet, the provider must accommodate the child’s individual developmental abilities and needs, in accordance with nationally recommended procedures, and as contained in the provider’s written policies and procedures.
 There is no specific age when toilet learning can begin as long as the child shows signs that they are ready.

    The home program must include outdoor play for all ages each day except when the severity of weather, including temperature extremes, makes it a health hazard or when a child must remain indoors as indicated in writing by a health care provider or in a health care plan.
   Inclement weather is defined by the Weather Watch chart which considers humidity, wind chill and shade.
During inclement weather, the outdoor time can be substituted with indoor gross motor play.
  There is strong evidence that infant, toddler and preschool age children experience significant health benefits from outdoor play including: strengthening immune systems, maintenance of a healthy weight and Vitamin D exposure.
Current research also shows children who play outside are less likely to be nearsighted. “Direct exposure to the bright, natural light that comes from being outside may stimulate developing eyes in important ways such as maintaining the correct distance between the lens and the retina — which keeps vision in focus.”

Sample Written Policies and Procedures
1. Admission and registration procedures.
Inform parents/guardians what your policies are regarding admission and registration.
EXAMPLE: An interview and tour of my home will be completed prior to your child being accepted into care. If after the interview and tour we feel that my home will be a good fit you will need to provide the following information prior to or on your child’s first day of care: emergency medical authorization, contact information for parents/guardians and emergency contact, immunization record, health care information and plan (if applicable).
2. Authorization of parents or other designees to pick up children, including the policy for how the provider will respond to individuals not authorized by parents/guardians to pick up a child and if a parent arrives under the influence of drugs and or alcohol.
Explain to parents how you will handle children being picked up by persons authorized by parent or guardian. Explain how you will handle non-authorized persons attempting to pick up a child, Explain how you will handle a person who arrives to pick up a child and they are under the influence of drugs or alcohol.
 EXAMPLE:
Children will be released only to persons listed on their enrollment form. Anyone not known to the provider will be asked to provide and ID. If you have an emergency and need someone not listed on the enrollment form to pick up your child you will need to call and give verbal authorization. That person will need to show ID. If someone attempts to pick up your child and they are not authorized 911 will be called.
A parent has the right to pick up their child whether they are listed on the enrollment form or not unless court orders do not allow for this. I will need to have a copy of any court orders. If you or any other person arrives to pick up a child and appear to be under the influence of drugs or alcohol I will encourage you to let me call someone to come get you. If you leave with your child I will call 911 and report you.
3. An itemized fee schedule or individual fee agreement; fee expectations when fees may be reimbursed, when child does not attend program; when child is requested to leave the program; and authorization for field trips.
Explain to parents what your fees are and when you expect to be paid. Check with your local R&R for fee comparisons in you area. Will there ever be a time when fees may be reimbursed? If so, please explain. Do parents have to pay when their child does not attend? If a child is requested to leave the program will any fees be reimbursed?
Explain how you will handle authorizations for field trips. Will you require a blanket form for all trips or will you use individual authorizations.
EXAMPLE:
Fee for fulltime Infant care is $XXX per week. Fee for part time Infant care is $XX per week. Fee for fulltime Toddler care is $XXX per week. Fee for part time Toddler care is $XX per week. Etc ...
Fees must be paid by 5:00 pm Friday for the upcoming week. The only time a fee will be reimbursed is if your child is requested to immediately leave the program. Any payment for future days will be returned within XX days. A blanket field trip for must be signed during registration. Parents/guardians will be notified of any and all field trips.
 
4. Procedure, including fees, when a child arrives or departs other than expected agreed upon care hours.
Will you be charging parents if they are late picking up or arrive early or late for the day?
EXAMPLE: If you are late picking up your child there will be a 1000.00 dollar per minute late fee that is due in cash when you arrive.
5. Parent and provider responsibilities for special activities or programs outside of the licensed facility, such as inclusion and/or exclusion of children and the payment of additional fees.
Will you be participating in activities outside of the home? Swimming lessons, gymnastics or just field trips. Are the fees for these activities included in your fee for care or do you require parents to pay for them? Are parents given a choice if their child will participate or not?
EXAMPLE: Every summer we take 3 field trips to XXXXXXX and parents will be asked to provide their child with
a sack lunch and $XXX to cover admission. If you do not want your child to attend you will need to make alternate arrangements for their care that day.
6. Hours of operation or individual hours agreement to include regularly closed days and applicable special program hours; policy on closure due to provider illness or family emergency and unscheduled closures.
Carefully consider your hours of operation. The hours you choose are what your families will count on and your “official” work day If you are open from 6:30am until 6:00pm will you have individual hours for each child? What holidays are you closed? When will you close due to illness or family emergency?
EXAMPLE: ABC child care is open from 6:30am until 6:00pm. No child can be in care for longer than 10 hours per day unless the parent/guardian is a shift worker. I am closed on Christmas, 2 weeks in the summer and National Potato week. In the unlikely event that I am too ill to care for your child I will notify you by 6:00am.
7. Procedure for managing a situation where children remain after the scheduled closure of the facility and the parent, guardian or other emergency contacts cannot be reached. This may include notification of the local county department of social services or police, if necessary. In the event that the provider has not been approved for overnight care, the provider cannot keep the children in care beyond midnight.
How long are you willing to keep a child if the parent is late? How long will you wait before you begin calling emergency contacts? Do you have overnight care on your license? If not, the child cannot stay past midnight. At what point will you contact authorities to pick up the child.
EXAMPLE: If your child has not been picked up within XX minutes/hours after closure and I have not heard from you I will begin to contact the emergency contacts on your enrollment form. If no one can be located within XX I will contact local authorities/social services to pick up your child.
 
8. Activities and snacks for children who remain at the home after closing. What type of care will be provided to a child who has not been picked up? Will you provide dinner? Will you take the
child with you to evening family activities?
EXAMPLE: In the event you are unable to pick your child up on time I will feed your child dinner. Your child may have to come with us to our evening events, such as: karate and dance lessons. If you and your emergency contacts cannot be reached by XXpm local authorities will be called.
9. Services offered for children with special needs in compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act.
If you offer services above and beyond the minimum required to be in compliance with ADA add those services to your policies.
EXAMPLE: I accept children based on the Americans with Disabilities Act. My home can easily accommodate a child in a wheelchair. I am able to provide transportation to and from therapy sessions.
10. Acceptance of non-immunized children and notification if the provider’s own birth, adopted, or step children have not been immunized.
Are your own children fully immunized? Are you willing to accept children who are not fully immunized?
EXAMPLE: My own children are fully immunized. I accept children into care that may be exempt from some or all immunizations. Be advised that your children may be in care with children that are not fully immunized.
11. Substitute care, and the clarification of responsibility for obtaining back-up care.
Consider whether or not you will need regular substitute care. Will you provide the care or will parents need to find their own care? How will you handle emergency situations?
EXAMPLE: I will provide substitute care when I will be away from the home for my own or my children’s preplanned personal appointments. I will use my sister XXXX XXXX who is familiar with the policies of the home, regulations and the children. In the event of an emergency I will notify you and you will need to find care on your own.
12. How and by whom children are supplied with appropriate clothing and equipment necessary to participate in indoor and outdoor activities, including helmets, wrist protection, and knee and elbow pads when riding a scooter, bicycle, skateboard or rollerblades.
Will you be participating in any activities that will require the children to have additional or different equipment.
EXAMPLE: Friday’s are bike day and I would like for every parent to send their child with their bike helmet. Each child will need to have a swimming suit on Monday and Fridays. Please send your child a large shirt or cover-up to leave here for our messy play i.e.: painting, play dough, sand and water play.
 
13. Storage, loss, damage or theft of provider’s or child’s personal belongings.
Think about what accommodations you can make for children to leave items in you home overnight. If a child causes damage to your home or takes something do you expect to be compensated? Will you be responsible for the loss, damage or theft of a child’s belongings?
EXAMPLE: Each child will have a storage bin that they can leave extra clothes and supplies in. In the event that your child intentionally causes damage to my property or theft occurs you, as the parent will be responsible for compensation. Please do not send your child with something so valuable that it cannot be replaced.
14. Scheduled and unscheduled trips away from the family child care home; the requirement of notification of the excursion prior to the event and need for signed permission from the parent(s) or guardian(s) for the excursion and a phone number where the provider can be reached during a field trip.
Will you be taking both scheduled and unscheduled trips away from the home? This includes the quick trip to the grocery store or other errands. Do you take children to something like swimming lessons? Do you take children on ‘field trips? How will you notify of parents of the excursions?
EXAMPLE: Parents will need to sign permission for scheduled field trips and activities as well as the occasional unplanned excursion. Parents will be notiffed in writing of any ‘field trip or scheduled activity. In the event that we need to run an errand such as a trip to the grocery store, I will call each parent on their primary phone number and let you know where we are going. Each parent will be given my cell phone number so that they can contact me when we are out.
Or
This home does not take any scheduled or unscheduled trips away from the home.
15. Transportation availability, vehicle restraint requirements, and seating capacities.
What vehicle will you use to transport children? Do you have appropriate restraints? How many children can you transport?
EXAMPLE: I use a Ford Explorer that can safely seat 5 children in the back two rows of seats. The vehicle is not equipped with infant or booster seats. Parents must provide a car seat appropriate for their child.
16. Written authorization or denial for media use including, but not limited to, television shows, video, music, software used at the facility and time limits for all media use.
Carefully describe the types of media use that will be used in your home. It is not necessary to list every movie or game, just the type and or rating. Parents have the right to refuse to allow their child to use the media in your home.
EXAMPLE:
Parents need to give written permission for their child to participate in the following media use. We watch G rated movies and TV and they are of an educational nature only. Children will not watch TV for more than 30 minutes per day, except for the special occasion movie. There is a computer available for older children to do homework. There are very strict parental controls and children will be supervised while using it. They will not be allowed to use the computer for more than 30 minutes unless you give special permission for work on a big project. We do not play any video games but do listen to children’s and classical music.
 
17. Meals, snacks, and parental notification of menus, and how children with food allergies are accommodated.
Will you be serving breakfast, lunch, dinner (for those providing care during the dinner hour), snacks? Will parents provide meals and snacks for children? How will you notify parents of the food served to their child? If you have a child with a food allergy how will you ensure they will not be exposed to that food item?
EXAMPLE: Breakfast is served at 8:00, mid morning snack at 10:00, lunch at 12:00 and afternoon snack at 3:00.
Food served will be nutritious and delicious and meet your child’s daily nutritional requirements for the meal or snack served. Please see the whiteboard near the sign in book to see what we will be eating today. If your child has a food allergy I need to know so that access to that food can be limited.
18. Policy on transitioning a child from either breast feeding to a bottle and/or cup, or from a bottle to a cup.
At the time of enrollment will you be discussing the infants feeding schedule? Is the child bottle fed? When will mom introduce the bottle is the infant has only been breast fed? As the infant matures when and how will you and the parents transition the infant from a bottle?
EXAMPLE: For infants that have only breastfed it will be an easier transition for your baby if you begin introducing
a bottle at least two weeks before care begins. When you feel your baby is ready to begin the transition to a cup or sippie please talk with me so that we can work together on this process.
19. Behavior guidance and discipline appropriate to the age and development the child, including positive instruction, supporting positive behavior, discipline, and consequences. Policies shall include how the provider will: a. Cultivate positive child, provider, staff (if applicable), and family relationships;
b. Create and maintain a socially and emotionally respectful early learning and care environment;
c. Implement strategies supporting positive behavior, pro-social peer interaction, and overall social and emotional competence in young children;
d. Provide individualized social emotional intervention supports for children who need them, including methods for understanding child behavior; and developing, adopting, and implementing a team-based positive behavior support plan with the intent to reduce challenging behavior and prevent suspensions and expulsions; and,
e. Access an early childhood mental health consultant or other specialist, as needed.
It is important to clearly state the means of guidance that you plan to use with the children in your care. If redirection is used, if time outs are used, if natural consequences are used it is important for parents to know what to expect. If you never use time outs then the parents should not expect to hear from their child that they were in time out today.
EXAMPLE:
A variety of methods will be used to cultivate positive relations with family. Regular conference
meetings are held to keep the provider and family members in close communication regarding the child. There will be quarterly open houses and dinner will be provided. This environment is warm and welcoming so all children and parents feel a sense of belonging and membership. Our goal is to foster positive relationships between families to create a sense of community that allows for open communication should a challenge arise.
 
In this environment children are able to learn at their own pace based on their individual temperaments, development, and culture. Children will be taught and encouraged to express themselves, understand the feelings of others and how to communicate their wants, needs, and feelings.
The provider, parents and, if needed, a mental health consultant will work together on persistent challenges. As a team we will identify an action plan to support the needs of the child.
20. Rest time and equipment.
Will all children be having a rest time? What equipment for resting do you provide? Do you require parents to provide
any rest equipment? How long will children rest?
EXAMPLE: Infants and toddlers will be provided with a crib or futon meeting National Safety Standards. They will form their own sleeping and waking patterns. Preschool age children will have a rest on a nap mat with a sheet and blanket. If older children would like a rest or need a rest they will be provided with a nap mat, sheet and blanket. If preschool age children (and older) do not fall asleep after 30 minutes they will be offered an age appropriate quiet activity. Rest time in the home is from approximately XXX until XXX.
21. Diapering and toilet training, including, but not limited to, process, communication, time frames, supplies, and expectation.
Clearly indicate what supplies you will require parents to provide for both diapering and toilet training. Do you use a certain toilet training method? What signs do you look for to indicate a child is ready to begin toilet training?
EXEMPT:
When your child is in diapers you will need to provide diapers, diaper wipes, diaper rash ointment/cream and extra clothing. When your child begins to ask questions about using the toilet and is able to dress and undress unassisted and we both feel the child is ready we can begin toilet training. You will then need to provide underpants and plenty of extra clothes. I do not have a speciffc method I use as my experience has shown me that each child’s experience is unique. It is important for all of the child’s caregivers to be consistent with the toilet training.
22. Provision of daily outside play time.
Evaluate your environment and think about how much time you can realistically spend outside.
EXAMPLE: All children will play outside daily, weather permitting. The amount of time will depend on the weather and the day. There will be times when the weather extremes will keep us inside.
23. Use of and how often sunscreen is applied, including authorization for use of sunscreen, and how infants are protected from sun exposure without the use of sunscreen.
Will you provide sunscreen or do you want parents to provide it? How will infants too young to have sunscreen applied, be protected?
EXAMPLE: Parents must provide sunscreen for their child. Written authorization for the application is needed. During summer months and nice weather please apply sunscreen to your child before you arrive. I will reapply according to our activity and manufacturers recommendations. Please provide a sunhat for your infant. Infants will have outdoor playtime but will be in the shade whenever possible.
 
24. Protection of children from exposure to second (2N°) hand smoke.
Do you or anyone in your home smoke? Will there be visitors that smoke?
EXAMPLE: Children will never be exposed to second hand smoke in the home or car. If visitors to the home smoke they will not be allowed to smoke in the home or play yard.
25. Notification of parents or guardians for handling children’s illnesses, accidents, injuries, or other emergencies.
How will you determine if a parent wants to be called every time their child has a bump or bruise, cough or sneeze? Some parents will want to be called each and every time and some are fine with being informed of minor accidents and illness at the end of the day.
EXAMPLE: In the event that your child becomes ill and needs to leave care you will be asked to come pick up your child within one hour. If your child is injured and requires medical attention you will be notified immediately. Small bumps and bruises are an every day event for most children at some point in their lives. If you would like to be notified each time please let me know and you will be notified. Otherwise you will be notified at the end of the day. Other emergencies will be handled on a case by case basis.
26. Specific circumstances and symptoms for not admitting ill children and conditions for re-admittance.
Are you willing to take care of ill children? If so, how ill? If not, under what conditions will you readmit a child who has been ill?
EXAMPLE: Your child will need to be free of fever or diarrhea for 24 hours before they can return to care. If your child has been put on antibiotics they will need to wait 24 hour before returning. I reserve the right to request a statement from the child’s health care provide.
27. Storing, administering, recording and disposing children’s medicines in compliance with the State Department approved medication administration course.
As a provider you must be willing to give medications that are life saving or for a child with a condition under the ADA.
EXAMPLE: If your child requires medication you and the health care provider will need to complete the required authorization forms. The medication will need to be in the original container and given directly to me. It will be stored locked and inaccessible to children.
28. Adverse weather precautions to include temperature extremes; inclement weather expectations and procedures, and fee expectations if home is closed during inclement weather and notification of how to find out.
Under what weather conditions will the home close? How will parents be notified of the closure? If your home is closed due to weather do you expect to be paid?
EXAMPLE: This home will be open unless the public school district closes for the day. If the home closes payment is still expected for the days closed. In the event that the weather turns bad during the day please come as soon as it is safely possible. Your child will be well cared for until you are able to arrive.
 
29. Emergency response procedures that explain, at a minimum, the life saving procedure that will be followed and how the home will function during a fire, severe weather, lockdown, reverse evacuation, or shelter-in- place emergency situation.
What precautions have you taken to ensure that children will be safe in an emergency. Do you have an emergency kit? Will the children have activities, food, water, flashlights accessible during an emergency.
EXAMPLE:
In the event that we have an emergency that causes evacuation there is an emergency kit in the car that contains food, water, blankets and emergency numbers for the children. If you arrive at the home and no one is there due to an emergency we will be at the King Soopers on XXX and CCC. If that location is not safe the back up location is XXX XXX.
For emergencies that require that we take shelter in the home there is an emergency preparedness kit in the basement that contains food, water, ff ashlights and activities.
30. Reporting of child abuse, including the name of the county department
of social/human services and phone number of where a child abuse report should be made.
EXAMPLE: Suspected or known child abuse should be reported to XXXXX County at 3333333333.
31. Filing a complaint about a family child care home, including the name, address and telephone number of the Colorado Department of Human Services, Division of Early Care and Learning, where a complaint may be filed.
EXAMPLE: Complaints about a family child care home can be made to Division of Early Care and Learning at 303-866- 3755 or 1-800-799-5876. 1575 Sherman St. Denver Colorado 80203.
32. Where a parent may obtain the official Rules Regulating Family Child Care Homes, including the Secretary of State’s website.
EXAMPLE: The official Rules Regulating Family Child Care Homes can be obtained at the Division of Early Care and Learning 1575 Sherman St. Denver Colorado 80203, or at www.cdhs.state.so.us/childcare or http://www. sos.state.co.us/CCR
33. What steps are taken prior to the suspension, expulsion, or request to parents or guardians to withdraw a child from care due to concerns about the child’s behavioral issues, these procedures must be consistent with the policy on guidance, positive instruction, discipline, and consequences, and include documentation of the steps taken to understand and respond to challenging behavior.
EXAMPLE: The provider will conduct observations and documentation of ongoing concerns, progress and accomplishments. This information will be shared with parent/guardian and action plans will be updated accordingly.
 
34. Regularly identifying on a routine basis recalled toys, equipment and furnishings and developing a plan to remove the recalled items from the home.
How will you ensure the equipment you use has not been recalled?
EXAMPLE: I regularly receive emails updating me on current recalls. I regularly check my equipment for safety and value any input and knowledge you may have.

Sun and Water Safety Tips
Keep your family safe this summer by following these tips from the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP). Please feel free to use them in any print or broadcast story with appropriate attribution of source.
Click here for the Spanish Version. FUN IN THE SUN
Babies under 6 months:
• The two main recommendations from the AAP to prevent sunburn are to avoid sun exposure, and to dress infants in lightweight long pants, long-sleeved shirts and brimmed hats that shade the neck to prevent sunburn. However, when adequate clothing and shade are not available, parent(s)/guardian(s) can apply a minimal amount of sunscreen with at least 15 SPF (sun protection factor) to small areas, such as the infant's face and the back of the hands. If an infant gets sunburn, apply cool compresses to the affected area.
For All Other Children:
• The first, and best, line of defense against harmful ultraviolet radiation (UVR) exposure is covering up. Stay in the shade whenever possible and limit sun exposure during the peak intensity hours - between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m.
• Wear a hat with a three-inch brim or a bill facing forward, sunglasses (look for sunglasses that provide 97% -100% protection against both UVA and UVB rays), and clothing with a tight weave.
• On both sunny and cloudy days use a sunscreen with an SPF 15 or greater that protects against UVA and UVB rays.
• Be sure to apply enough sunscreen -- about one ounce per sitting for a young adult.
• Reapply sunscreen every two hours, or after swimming or sweating.
• Use extra caution near water and sand (and even snow) as they reflect UV rays and may result
in sunburn more quickly.
HEAT STRESS IN EXERCISING CHILDREN
• The intensity of activities that last 15 minutes or more should be reduced whenever high heat or humidity reach critical levels.
• At the beginning of a strenuous exercise program or after traveling to a warmer climate, the intensity and duration of outdoor activities should start low and then gradually increase over seven (7) to 14 days to acclimate to the heat, particularly if it is very humid.
• Before outdoor physical activities, children should drink freely and should not feel thirsty. During activities less than one (1) hour, water alone is fine. Kids should always have water or a sports drink available and take a break to drink every 20 minutes while active in the heat.
• Clothing should be light-colored, lightweight and limited to one (1) layer of absorbent material to facilitate evaporation of sweat. Sweat-saturated shirts should be replaced by dry clothing.
• Practices and games played in the heat should be shortened and there should be more frequent water/hydration breaks. Children should promptly move to cooler environments if they feel dizzy, lightheaded or nauseous.
 
HEAT STRESS IN INFANTS
Infants and small children are not able to regulate their body temperature in the same way that adults do. Every year, children die from heat stroke from being left in a hot car, often unintentionally, with the majority of these deaths occurring in children 3 and under. Here are a few tips for parent(s)/guardian(s) when traveling in a car with infants or young children:
• Always check the back seat to make sure all children are out of the car when you arrive at your destination.
• Avoid distractions while driving, especially cell phone use.
• Be especially aware of kids in the car when there is a change from the routine, i.e. someone
else is driving them in the morning, you take a different route to work or child care.
• Have your childcare provider call if your child has not arrived within 10 minutes of the
expected arrival time.
• Place you cell phone, bag or purse in the back seat, so you are reminded to check the back
seat when you arrive at your destination.
POOL SAFETY
• Never leave children alone in or near the pool or spa, even for a moment; close supervision by a responsible adult is the best way to prevent drowning in children.
• Whenever children under age 5 are in or around water, an adult, preferably one who knows how to swim and perform CPR, should be within arm's length, providing touch supervision.
• Install a fence at least 4 feet high around all four sides of the pool. The fence should not have openings or protrusions that a young child could use to get over, under or through.
• Make sure pool gates open out from the pool and self-close/self-latch at a height children can't reach. Consider alarms on the gate to alert you when someone opens the gate. Consider surface wave or underwater alarms as an added layer of protection.
• The safest fence is one that surrounds all 4 sides of the pool and completely separates the pool from the house and yard. If the house serves as the fourth side of the fence, install an alarm on the exit door to the yard and the pool. For additional protection, install window guards on windows facing the pool. Drowning victims have also used pet doors to gain access to pools. Keep all of your barriers and alarms in good repair with fresh batteries.
• Keep rescue equipment (a shepherd's hook or a long pole with a hook on the end and life preservers) and a portable telephone near the pool. Choose a shepherd's hook and other rescue equipment made of fiberglass or other materials that do not conduct electricity.
• Avoid inflatable swimming aids such as floaties. They are not a substitute for approved life vests and can give children and parent(s)/guardian(s) a false sense of security.
• Children over age one (1) may be at a lower risk of drowning if they have had some formal swimming instruction. However, there is no evidence that swimming lessons or water survival skills courses can prevent drowning in babies younger than one (1) year of age.
• The decision to enroll a child over age one (1) in swimming lessons should be made by the parent /guardian based on the child's developmental readiness and exposure to water, but swim programs should never be seen as drown proofing a child of any age.
• Avoid entrapment: Suction from pool and spa drains can trap a swimmer underwater. Do not use a pool or spa if there are broken or missing drain covers. Ask your pool operator if your pool or spa's drains are compliant with the Pool and Spa Safety Act. If you have a swimming pool or spa, ask your pool service representative to update your drains and other suction fitting with anti- entrapment drain covers and other devices or systems. See PoolSafely.gov for more information on the Virginia Graeme Baker Pool and Spa Safety Act.
• Large, inflatable, above-ground pools have become increasingly popular for backyard use. Children may fall in if they lean against the soft side of an inflatable pool. Although such pools are often exempt from local pool fencing requirements, it is essential that they be surrounded by an

appropriate fence just as a permanent pool would be so that children cannot gain unsupervised
access.
• If a child is missing, look for him or her in the pool or spa first.
• Share safety instructions with family, friends and neighbors.
BOATING SAFETY
• Children should wear life jackets at all times when on boats, docks or near bodies of water.
• Make sure the life jacket is the right size for your child. The jacket should not be loose and
should always be worn as instructed with all straps belted.
• Blow-up water wings, toys, rafts and air mattresses should not be used as life jackets or personal
flotation devices. Adults should wear life jackets for their own protection as well as to set a good
example.
• Adolescents and adults should be warned of the dangers of boating even as a passenger
when under the influence of alcohol, drugs and even some prescription medications.
OPEN WATER SWIMMING
• Never swim alone. Even good swimmers need buddies!
• A lifeguard (or another adult who knows about water rescue) needs to be watching children
whenever they are in or near the water. Younger children should be closely supervised while in
or near the water use touch supervision, keeping no more than an arm's length away.
• Make sure your child knows never to dive into water except when permitted by an adult
who knows the depth of the water and who has checked for underwater objects.
• Never let your child swim in canals or any fast moving water.
• Ocean swimming should only be allowed when a lifeguard is on duty.
• Teach children about rip currents. If you are caught in a rip current, swim parallel to shore until
you escape the current, and then swim back to shore.

Introduction
This rule package seeks to reduce the risk of infant mortality related to Sudden Unexpected Infant Death Syndrome (SUIDS) in licensed child care facilities by removing environmental hazards that researchers correlate to sudden infant death syndrome and other environmental causes of unexpected infant death.
“SIDS is the number one cause of death in infants one (1) month-one (1) year of age. Most SIDS deaths occur when in babies between one (1) month and four (4) months of age, and the majority (90%) of SIDS deaths occurs before an infant reaches six (6) months of age. However, SIDS deaths can occur anytime during the infant’s first year. Slightly more boys die of SIDS than do girls”. (http://www.nichd.nih.gov/sts/about/SIDS/Pages/fastfacts.aspx)
What is SIDS/SUID?
According to the Center for Disease Control (CDC): “Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) is defined as the sudden death of an infant less than one (1) year of age that cannot be explained after a thorough investigation is conducted, including a complete autopsy, examination of the death scene and a review of the clinical history. SIDS is the third leading cause of infant deaths in the United States and the leading cause of death in infants one (1) to 12 months old”. (http://www.cdc.gov/sids/aboutsuidandsids.htm)
There are approximately 4,000 sudden infant deaths a year in the United States. About half of those deaths are diagnosed as SIDS.
However, SIDS is not the cause of every sudden infant death. When an infant suddenly and unexpectedly dies, the death is called Sudden Unexpected Infant Death or SUID.
Sudden Unexpected Infant Death includes all unexpected infant deaths, including SIDS, as well as other infant deaths with an identifiable cause, such as suffocation or positional asphyxiation. Approximately one half of all SUID cases are identified as SIDS. Other infant deaths occur as a result of accidental causes, including suffocation; entrapment (when the infant gets trapped between two objects and can’t breathe); strangulation on or by an object; when something presses on or wraps around the infant’s neck, blocking the airway or positional asphyxiation (where the infant is placed in an unsafe sleep environment or unsafe sleep position, such as on the side with a positioning device or in a swing). Other causes of unexpected infant deaths are a result of disease or child abuse/neglect.
SIDS is not:
 SIDS is not the same as suffocation and is not caused by suffocation.  SIDS is not caused by vaccines, immunizations, or shots.
 SIDS is not contagious.
 SIDS is not the result of neglect or child abuse.
  
 SIDS is not caused by cribs.
 SIDS is not caused by vomiting or choking.
 SIDS is not completely preventable, but there are ways to reduce the
risk. (https://www.nichd.nih.gov/sts/about/SIDS/Pages/SIDSisNot.aspx)
Research shows that there are many ways to reduce the risk of Sudden Unexpected Infant
Death and other sleep-related causes of infant death:
Always use an approved crib
o Only use a crib that meets Consumer Product Safety Standards.
o Use of drop-side crib is prohibited by federal law.
o All cribs must have a certificate of compliance from the manufacturer.
o Read and follow manufacturer instructions, including instructions for set
up, use and care of the crib.
o Use a crib that has been manufactured for commercial use.
o Use a firm mattress that is manufactured for the specific crib type. o Bare is Best! (cpsc.gov) remove all soft bedding such as pillows,
sleep positioners, blankets, bumper pads, and stuffed toys.
o Use a fitted sheet that is tight-fitting (but not so tight the corners of the
mattress pull upward, creating gaps between the crib and the mattress). o Ensure the mattress supports are connected on all four sides and all
hardware is tight and in good condition.
o Never hang anything on or above the crib including blankets, mobiles or
other toys.
o Do not use a crib with loose or missing attachments or support
hardware; contact the manufacturer for replacements.
Always place the infant on his or her back to sleep:
o Sleeping on the back reduces the risk of SUID.
o Sleeping on the stomach or side increases the risk for SUID.
o Infants who are accustomed to sleeping on their backs but are then placed
to sleep on their stomachs are at a much higher risk for SUID.
o The back sleep position (also called supine) is the safest position for all infants.
 
Always use a firm sleep surface, in an approved crib, covered by a fitted sheet, to reduce the risk of SUID and other sleep-related causes of infant death.
o Infants who sleep on soft surfaces are at higher risk for SUID and suffocation. o Infants who sleep with a blanket, quilt or other soft bedding, are at higher
risk for SUID and suffocation.
o Always place the infant to sleep on the back, on a firm sleep surface, in an
approved crib, using a firm mattress that is designed to fit the make and
model of crib.
o Only use a well-fitting sheet, specifically made to snuggly fit the mattress, to
help prevent the infant from getting tangled up in the bedding or having the loose bedding create a suffocation hazard. On the other hand, a sheet that is too tight which causes the corners and sides of a mattress to curve upward can cause an entrapment and/or suffocation hazard. The mattress should lay flat on the base of the crib.
o Unless medically indicated by a physician, never allow an infant to sleep in a car seat, carrier, swing or similar product, even with parent/guardian permission. An infant may only sleep in a crib using an alternate sleep position with a signed health care plan from the child’s physician (tummy or side sleep).
o Never place the infant to sleep on soft surfaces, including, but not limited to: a couch, pillows, comforters, quilts or sheepskins. Never place the infant to sleep on a waterbed, soft mattress, bean bag, mat, air mattress or other soft bed that allows the infant's head to sink into the surface.
Avoid inappropriate sleep positions (positional asphyxiation)
o An infant’s airway is very soft, when the infant’s neck is too far forward onto the chest, too far back, or too far to the side, the airway can become constricted making it harder for the infant to breath. Infants aged one (1) year and younger are especially susceptible due to their lack of head and neck control and the weight of the head. Positional asphyxiation can occur when infants sleep in a semi-seated or slightly reclined position in car seats, swings or other infant equipment other than one their back, in an approved crib.
Always remove crib bumper pads from cribs
o While a crib may seem safer with bumper pads or similar products that attach to crib slats or sides, evidence does not support using crib bumpers to prevent injury. Unfortunately, an infant can suffocate in a crib where bumper pads are used.

Always keep soft objects, toys, crib bumpers and loose bedding out of the crib to reduce the risk of SUID and other sleep-related causes of infant death.
o Loose bedding and other items placed under or over the infant or in the infant's sleep area could end up covering the infant's face, which could:
 Put the infant at higher risk for suffocation or strangulation
 Put the infant at higher risk for rebreathing air that is low in oxygen
and high in carbon dioxide (rebreathing)
 Put the infant at higher risk of overheating
o It is reported that the majority of other sleep-related infant deaths are due to accidental suffocation involving soft bedding.
o Sleep positioners (i.e. wedges) are not necessary and may contribute to suffocation.
Avoid rebreathing
o What is rebreathing? Instead of breathing clean, fresh air, an infant “rebreathes” the exhaled air, which is high in carbon dioxide and low in oxygen. Normally, an infant would respond by coughing, crying or change positions. For whatever reason, there are occasions where an infant’s brain does not trigger a response and the infant continues to sleep through the rebreathing, which in turn can cause the infant to die suddenly and unexpectedly. Rebreathing can be caused by tummy sleeping, soft bedding or other items in a crib that traps carbon dioxide in and around the infant’s face and mouth.
Avoid over heating
o Infant sleep environments should be maintained at a comfortable temperature. The ideal temperature is maintained between 68 and 72 degrees.
o Infants are sensitive to extremes in temperature and cannot regulate their body temperatures well. Studies have shown that multiple layers or heavy clothing, heavy blankets, and warm room temperatures increase the risk of SUID. Infants who are in danger of overheating feel hot to the touch. (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health November 2, 2010 http://www.nih.gov/news/health/nov2010/nichd-02.htm)
o An overheated infant is more likely to go into a deep sleep which may make waking more difficult.
o Sleep sacks should be used instead of blankets.
 
o Infants in child care must not be swaddled, even with parent/guardian permission. Swaddling may only be done if medically indicated by a physician and the child care facility has a current, signed health care plan for swaddling.
Allow infants to use a pacifier, (only if the infant already uses a pacifier)
o Allowing an infant to use a clean, dry pacifier may reduce the risk of SUID. o Research shows that babies who used pacifiers while sleeping were
at significantly lower risk for SUID.
o Never force an infant to use the pacifier.
o Consider the following when using a pacifier:
 Because of the risk of strangulation, do not hang the pacifier around an infant's neck or attach it to his or her clothing with a string or cord.
 Do not coat the pacifier with anything sweet or sticky such as honey.
 Clean and replace the pacifier regularly.
 Follow the manufacturer age recommendation for the age of the infant
and size of pacifier.
 For breastfed infants, introduction of the pacifier should be delayed
until one (1) month of age to ensure that breastfeeding is firmly
established.
 If the pacifier falls out of the infant's mouth during sleep, it does not
need to be placed back in the mouth during that sleep time.
Avoid exposure to second hand smoke
o Infants whose caregivers smoke and who are exposed to second-hand smoke in their environment are at greater risk for SUID.
o Chemicals in secondhand smoke appear to affect the brain in ways that interfere with its regulation of infants' breathing. (Center for Disease Control http://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/fact_sheets/secondhand_smoke/hea lth_effects/index.htm#sids)
Avoid the use of products that claim to reduce the risk of SUID
o Wedges, positioners and other products that claim to reduce the risk of infant death have not been tested for safety or effectiveness. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the Consumer Product Safety Commission and the American Academy of Pediatrics warn against using these products because of the dangers they pose to infants.
   
o Avoid using products made from foam rubber or Memory FoamTM because of the risk of suffocation. (https://www.nichd.nih.gov/sts/about/risk/Pages/reduce.aspx)
Do provide supervised tummy time when infant is awake
o Research shows that:
 Placing the infant on his or her tummy for short periods while the infant
is awake and when someone is actively supervising the infant is an
important part of healthy development.
 Active supervision of tummy time helps the infant’s neck, shoulder,
and arm muscles get stronger.
 When an infant spends too much time in the same position, pressure
on the same part of the infant's head can cause flat spots. These flat spots are usually not dangerous, are not associated with long-term problems with head shape and typically go away on their own once the infant starts sitting up. Tummy time can help reduce or prevent flat spots.
 Other ways to prevent flat spots:
• Hold the infant when he or she is not sleeping.
• Limit the amount of time the infant spends in car seats,
bouncers, swings and carriers.
• Change the direction the infant lies in the crib from one week to
the next (i.e. have the infant’s feet point toward one end of the crib one week, and then have the feet point toward the other end of the crib the next week).
(https://www.nichd.nih.gov/sts/about/Pages/tummytime.aspx)
• Position the infant so that he or she will have to turn away from the flattened side of the head to look at you or to track movement or sound in the room. Move the crib occasionally to give the infant a new vantage point. Never rest an infant’s head on a pillow or other type of soft bedding. (http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-

Caring for our Children 3.1.4 Safe Sleep
http://cfoc.nrckids.org/StandardView/SpcCol/Safe_sleep
Caring for our Children Recommendations:
Facilities should develop a written policy that describes the practices to be used to promote safe sleep when infants are napping or sleeping. The policy should explain that these practices aim to reduce the risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) or suffocation death and other infant deaths that could occur when an infant is in a crib or asleep.
        
All staff, parent(s)/guardian(s), volunteers and others approved to enter rooms where infants are cared for should receive a copy of the Safe Sleep Policy and additional educational information and training on the importance of consistent use of safe sleep policies and practices before they are allowed to care for infants (i.e., first day of employment/volunteering/subbing). Documentation that training has occurred and that these individuals have received and reviewed the written policy should be kept on file.
All staff, parent(s)/guardian(s), volunteers and others who care for infants in the child care setting should follow these required safe sleep practices as recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) (1):
• Infants up to 12 months of age should be placed for sleep in a supine position (wholly on their back) for every nap or sleep time unless the infant’s primary care provider has completed a signed waiver indicating that the child requires an alternate sleep position;
Infants should be placed for sleep in safe sleep environments; which includes: a firm crib mattress covered by a tight-fitting sheet in a safety-approved crib (the crib should meet the standards and guidelines reviewed/approved by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission [CPSC] and ASTM International [ASTM]), no monitors or positioning devices should be used unless required by the child’s primary care provider and no other items should be in a crib occupied by an infant except for a pacifier;
Infants should not nap or sleep in a car safety seat, bean bag chair, bouncy seat, infant seat, swing, jumping chair, play pen or play yard, highchair, chair, futon or any other type of furniture/equipment that is not a safety-approved crib (that is in compliance with the CPSC and ASTM safety standards) (4);
If an infant arrives at the facility asleep in a car safety seat, the parent(s)/guardian(s) or caregiver/teacher should immediately remove the sleeping infant from this seat and place them in the supine position in a safe sleep environment (i.e., the infant’s assigned crib);
If an infant falls asleep in any place that is not a safe sleep environment, staff should immediately move the infant and place them in the supine position in their crib;
Only one infant should be placed in each crib (stackable cribs are not recommended);
Soft or loose bedding should be kept away from sleeping infants and out of safe sleep environments. These include, but are not limited to: bumper pads, pillows, quilts, comforters, sleep positioning devices, sheepskins, blankets, flat sheets, cloth diapers, bibs, etc. Also, blankets/items should not be hung on the sides of cribs. Swaddling infants when they are in a crib is not necessary or recommended, but rather one-piece sleepers should be used (see Standard 3.1.4.2 for more detail information on swaddling);

Toys, including mobiles and other types of play equipment that are designed to be attached to any part of the crib should be kept away from sleeping infants and out of safe sleep environments;
When caregivers/teachers place infants in their crib for sleep, they should check to ensure that the temperature in the room is comfortable for a lightly clothed adult, check the infants to ensure that they are comfortably clothed (not overheated or sweaty), and that bibs, necklaces and garments with ties or hoods are removed (clothing sacks or other clothing designed for sleep can be used in lieu of blankets);
Infants should be directly observed by sight and sound at all times, including when they are going to sleep, are sleeping or are in the process of waking up;
Bedding should be changed between children, and if mats are used, they should be cleaned between uses.
The lighting in the room must allow the caregiver/teacher to see each infant’s face, to view the color of the infant’s skin, and to check on the infant’s breathing and placement of the pacifier (if used).
A caregiver/teacher trained in safe sleep practices and approved to care for infants should be present in each room at all times where there is an infant. This caregiver/teacher should remain alert and should actively supervise sleeping infants in an ongoing manner. Also, the caregiver/teacher should check to ensure that the infant’s head remains uncovered and re- adjust clothing as needed.
The construction and use of sleeping rooms for infants separate from the infant group room is not recommended due to the need for direct supervision. In situations where there are existing facilities with separate sleeping rooms, facilities should develop a plan to modify room assignments and/or practices to eliminate placing infants to sleep in separate rooms.

 Child Care Weather Watch
Watching the weather is just part of the job for child care providers. Planning for playtime, field trips or weather safety is part of the daily routine. The changes in weather require the child care provider to attend to the health and safety of children in their care. What clothing, beverages and sun screen are appropriate? Dress children to maintain a comfortable body temperature (warmer months - lightweight cotton, colder months - wear layers of clothing). Drinking beverages helps the body maintain a comfortable temperature. Water or fruit juices are best. Avoid high sugar content beverages and soda pop. Sunscreen may be used year around. Use a sunscreen labeled as SPF-15 or higher. Apply sunscreen generously and frequently. Read the label of the sunscreen product. You can also use sunscreen to block harmful rays from the sun. Look for sunscreen with UVB and UVA ray protection. Have children play in shaded areas or create shade in the play area.
■ Condition OHEEM - Most children may play outdoors and be comfortable. Child care providers should watch for the child that becomes uncomfortable while playing outdoors.
INFANTS AND TODDLERS Infants/toddlers are unable to tell the child care provider if they are too hot or cold. The infant/toddler may become fussy when uncomfortable. Infants/toddlers tolerate shorter periods of outdoor play. Dress infants/toddlers in lightweight cotton or cotton-like fabrics during the warmer months. In cooler or cold months dress infants in layers to keep them warm. Protect infants from the sun by using sunscreen and playing in shaded areas. Give beverages while playing outdoors. YOUNG CHILDREN Use precautions regarding clothing, sunscreen, and beverages. Young children need to be reminded to stop play and drink a beverage and apply more sunscreen.
OLDER CHILDREN Use precautions for clothing, beverages, and sunscreen. The older child needs a firm approach to wearing
proper clothing for the weather (they may want to play without coats, hats or mittens). Apply sunscreen and give beverages while
■ outdoors.
ConditionAErrOM meansthechildcareprovidermustusecautionandcloselyobservethechildrenforsignsofbeingtoo hot or cold while outdoors. Clothing, sunscreen, and beverages are important. Shorten the length of outdoor time.
INFANTS AND TODDLERS Child care providers should use the precautions outlined in Condition Green. Clothing,
sunscreen, and beverages are important. Shorten the length of time for outdoor play.
YOUNG CHILDREN Use the precautions regarding clothing, sunscreen, and beverages. Younger children may insist they are not too hot or cold because they are enjoying playtime. Child care providers need to structure the length of time for outdoor play for the young child.
OLDER CHILDREN Use precautions for clothing, sunscreen, and beverages. Use a firm approach to wearing proper clothing for the weather (they may want to play without coats, hats or mittens), applying sunscreen and drinking liquids remain
■ important while playing outdoors.
During condition HED most children should not play outdoors due to the health risk.
INFANTS/TODDLERS should play indoors and have ample space for large motor play.
YOUNG CHILDREN may ask to play outside and do not understand the potential danger of weather conditions. OLDER CHILDREN may play outdoors for very short periods of time. Child care providers must be vigilant about proper clothing, beverages, and use of sunscreen.
