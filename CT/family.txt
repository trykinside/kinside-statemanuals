(b) Suitability. A registration will not be issued to any applicant, or renewed for a provider,
unless the Commissioner finds that such applicant or provider is a suitable person to care for children in a family day care home and meets and agrees to comply with Sections 17- 585-1 to 17-585-16 inclusive of these regulations. Suitability shall be determined by a review of the application materials, references, any criminal records, law enforcement records, medical records, protective services records and any other relevant material obtained by the Department. The Commissioner shall, after reviewing all the circumstances, make a determination whether the applicant or provider is a suitable person to care for children in a family day care home and whether the children's health and safety would be at risk under said applicant or provider's care.
(c) Nontransferability of the Registration. An applicant may apply for a registration only in his/her own name and only for the premises indicated on the application, which premises shall be a residence.
(1) A registration shall not be assigned by a provider to any other person under any
circumstances. A provider shall not use a substitute on a regularly, recurring basis which effectively franchises or transfers the family day care services to the substitute.

School age children who are not the provider's own children and receive family day care services for three (3) or more hours before school or three (3) or more hours after school shall be counted in the regular capacity. The regular capacity of a family day care home shall not exceed six (6) children.
(B) School age capacity defines the maximum number of additional children attending school full time that a provider may care for together before and after school during the school year only, including the provider's own school age children.

The school age capacity of a family day care home shall not exceed three (3) children.
(2) Children attending full day kindergarten shall be counted in the school age capacity; children attending half day kindergarten shall be counted as preschoolers in the regular capacity until graduation from kindergarten.
(3) Staff members' children present at the facility shall be counted in the capacity like the other children receiving care.
(4) Foster children and children who reside at the facility shall be counted as household members in the same manner as the provider's own children.
(5) The provider's own children twelve (12) years of age and older shall not count in the capacity.
(6) The registered capacity shall be determined at the Commissioner's discretion taking into account the indoor and outdoor space and other accommodations
available for child care at the facility and the qualifications of the applicant or provider.

(f) Variance of Requirements. A family day care home and provider shall comply with all family day care regulations unless a variance for specific requirement(s) has been granted through a prior written agreement with the Commissioner. This agreement shall specify the particular requirement(s) affected, the duration of the variance, and the terms under which the variance is granted. Variance of specific requirements shall be granted only when the home and provider have documented that the intent of the specific requirement(s) affected will be satisfactorily achieved in a manner other than that prescribed by the requirement(s). A variance shall not be given to allow a provider to care for more children than indicated by the registered capacity. When the home or provider fail to comply with the variance agreement in any particular, the agreement shall be subject to immediate cancellation.
(g) Registration Certificate. Upon approval of the initial application and or renewal application, and payment of the fee, a registration certificate shall be signed by the Commissioner and issued to the provider. The registration certificate shall identify the provider's name, the address of the facility, the registered capacity of the family day care home, the registration number and the expiration date.
(1) The registration certificate remains the property of the Department and shall be surrendered to the Commissioner if the registration is suspended, revoked, or voluntarily terminated.
