FOREWORD
The Delaware General Assembly recognized the need for protecting children receiving care outside their own homes as early as 1915. Delaware currently requires early care and education and school-age centers to be licensed as authorized in the 31 Delaware Code, Sections 341-345, also known as “The Delaware Child Care Act.” The licensing law defines the type of facilities that the State regulates, and gives the authority to “prescribe reasonable standards” and “license these (facilities)” to the Office of Child Care Licensing (OCCL). The purpose of the law is to protect the health, safety, and well-being of the children who receive care in out-of-home settings. An early care and education and school-age centers must meet the requirements of these regulations in order to operate.
While creating these regulations, OCCL considered the following: comments from early child care professionals, school-age child care professionals, stakeholders, and the Provider Advisory Board; federal requirements; licensing regulations of other states; and current research in child development, early care and education, school-age care, health, safety, and nutrition, applicable to early care and education and school-age centers.

3. A licensee shall ensure high school diplomas or equivalents, college transcripts, or degrees from other countries used to verify education for a position are evaluated by an independent credentialing agency accepted by OCCL or its designee.
