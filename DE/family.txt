NOTICE OF RESCISSION AND PROMULGATION
The Office of Child Care Licensing, Division of Family Services, Department of Services for Children, Youth and Their Families adopts and promulgates the following regulations for family and large family child care homes as authorized in the Delaware Code, Title 31, Chapter 3, Subchapter III, Subsec- tions 341-345, also known as “The Delaware Child Care Act.” All previous requirements and regula- tions pertaining to such facilities are void. These regulations shall take effect on May 1, 2019.

FOREWORD
The Delaware General Assembly recognized the need for protecting children receiving care outside their own homes as early as 1915. Delaware currently requires family and large family child care homes to be licensed as authorized in the 31 Delaware Code, Sections 341-345, also known as “The Delaware Child Care Act.” The licensing law defines the type of facilities that the State regulates, and gives the authority to “prescribe reasonable standards” and “license these (facilities)” to the Office of Child Care Licensing (OCCL). The purpose of the law is to protect the health, safety, and well-being of the children who receive care in out-of-home settings. A family or large family child care home must meet the requirements of these regulations in order to operate.
These regulations are divided into three parts. Part I describes the regulations that both family and large family child care homes are required to follow. Part II shows the additional regulations for family child care homes. Part III contains the regulations that large family child care homes are required to follow.
While creating these regulations, OCCL considered the following: comments from family and large family child care providers and stakeholders; federal requirements; licensing regulations of other states; and current research in child development, early care and education, school-age care, health, safety, and nutrition, applicable to family and large family child care.

4. Definition of Regulated Services
A. Family child care is a licensed child care service offered by a person or a person who formed an entity. OCCL names this person or entity a licensee. A licensee provides this service for less than 24 hours per day and children attend without a parent/guardian. A licensee receives payment for services provided. There are two types of family child care; a level I may have a maximum of five or six children depending on their ages and a level II may have a maximum of nine children depending on their ages. Children living in the home who do not attend kindergarten or a higher grade count in these numbers. These regulations describe the ages of children allowed to be present in each type. A licensee provides care, education, protection, supervision, or guidance to children in his or her private home. Child care provided only to a person's own children, grandchildren, nieces, nephews, or stepchildren does not require a family child care license even if payment is received.
9

B. Large family child care is a licensed child care service offered by a person or entity such as a company. OCCL names this person or entity a licensee. A licensee provides this service for less than 24 hours per day and children attend without a parent/guardian. A licensee receives payment for services provided. A licensee may have a maximum of 12 children. The ages of the children will determine the number of staff needed. Children living in the home who do not attend kindergarten or a higher grade count in these numbers. A licensee provides care, education, protection, supervision, or guidance to children in a private home or non-residential setting. Child care provided only to a person's own children, grandchildren, nieces, nephews, or stepchildren does not require a large family child care license even if payment is received.
C. An individual or entity, such as a company, corporation, business, or agency, may not operate or provide child care services as defined in these regulations unless OCCL issues a family or large family child care license. Anyone who operates a home without a license violates 31 Del.C. §§341-345, The Delaware Child Care Act, and shall be fined not more than $100 or imprisoned not more than three months, or both.
5. Authority to Inspect
A. Applicants, licensees, household members, and staff members, if applicable, shall allow access to the home during the hours of operation. This includes access to information, files, documents, and video recordings needed to determine compliance. If there is a question of regulatory compliance, access to unlicensed space must be granted. Access must be granted to officials from OCCL and other State and local agencies to determine compliance with applicable codes, regulations, or laws. A licensee shall ensure agencies providing payment for child care services are also granted access.
B. Applicants, licensees, household members, and staff members, if applicable, shall allow and not hinder the interviewing of a licensee, staff member, household member, child in care, or child's parent/guardian by officials from OCCL or other State and local agencies. Interviews will occur to determine compliance with these regulations and other applicable codes, regulations, or laws. A licensee shall cooperate and have staff members cooperate with division investigations regarding allegations of child abuse or neglect.
6. License Requirements
