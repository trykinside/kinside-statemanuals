(1) Application.
(a) Application for a license or for renewal of a license to operate a child care facility must be made on CF-FSP Form 5017, October 2017, Application for a License to Operate a Child Care Facility, which is incorporated by reference. CF-FSP Form 5017 may be obtained from the department’s website at www.myflfamilies.com/childcare or from the following link http://www.flrules.org/Gateway/reference.asp?No=Ref-08728.
(b) Each completed CF-FSP Form 5017 must be submitted with the licensure fee pursuant to section 402.315, F.S.
(c) The completed CF-FSP Form 5017 must be signed by the individual owner, prospective owner, or the designated representative of a partnership, association, or corporation, and must include background screening clearance documents for the owner/operator/director, and an approved fire inspection. Child care facilities that have a well system must maintain current written records indicating the well system meets the requirements of the Department of Health on an annual basis.
(d) A completed CF-FSP Form 5017 for renewal of an annual license must be submitted to the licensing authority at least 45 days prior to the expiration date of the current license to ensure that a lapse of licensure does not occur. Failure to submit a completed CF-FSP Form 5017 at least 45 days prior to the expiration date of the current license constitutes a licensing violation as defined in paragraph 65C-22.010(2)(c), F.A.C.
(2) Urban Child Care.
(a) In order to be classified as an urban child care facility, the applicant, prior to submitting an application for licensure must:
1. Obtain written documentation from the local governing body that confirms the geographical area has been declared urban; and,
2. Consult with the licensing authority to verify that the required outdoor play space, required by section 3.4.4, B of the Child Care Facility Handbook does not exist or cannot be made available. Urban designation will not be granted if the licensing authority determines space for an outdoor play area is available. Outdoor play space is “available” if appropriate space:
a. Is adjacent to the facility, or
b. Can be reached by a route that is free of hazards and is within 1/8 mile of the facility.
(b) If requirements in subparagraph 1., above, are met, the applicant must complete and submit the CF-FSP Form 5017.
(c) No application for an urban child care facility designation will be approved by the licensing authority without the above criteria being met.
(3) License.
(a) A child care facility license is issued in the name of the owner. The owner may be an individual, partnership, association, or corporation. The license is non-transferable between owners and locations.
(b) During the hours of operation, the child care facility must not be used for any business or purpose unrelated to providing child care that can interfere with compliance with child care standards or permit the presence of individuals who do not meet screening and training requirements when children are present. A child care facility that utilizes any area that is subject to use by persons outside of the program must have exclusive control of such area when used by the program and provide effective measures to exclude individuals who do not meet screening and training requirements from that area.
(c) The child care facility must include their license number in any advertisement about their services.
(d) The Department may issue a provisional license allowing a facility to operate for a designated period of time while working to correct one or more licensing standard(s) not met, provided the owner is making adequate provisions to ensure the health and safety of the children in care. A provisional license is a not a disciplinary sanction.
(4) Change of ownership.
(a) At least one week prior to changing ownership of a child care facility, in compliance with section 402.305(18), F.S., one of the following methods of notification to custodial parents or legal guardians must be observed:

2. Incorporating information into an existing newsletter, or
3. Distribute individual letters or flyers.
(b) A completed CF-FSP Form 5017 for a change of ownership must be submitted by the new prospective owner to the licensing authority prior to the final sale of the business. The Department has 45 days from receiving a completed application to issue a license to the new prospective owner.
(5) Supervision.
(a) Children that are delivered to a location offsite from the facility by someone other than the parent or guardian become the responsibility of the child care program at that designated location and time as agreed upon by the provider and the parent/guardian. The provider is responsible for the supervision of the child upon the child’s arrival at the designated point. If a child is not present at the time of pick-up, prior to leaving the designated location, child care personnel must verify the whereabouts of the child.
(b) Direct supervision means actively watching and directing children’s activities within the same room or designated outdoor play area, during transportation, any activity outside of the facility, and responding to the needs of each child while in care. Child care personnel at a facility must be assigned to provide direct supervision to a specific group of children, and be present with that group of children at all times.
(6) Child Care Standards. Child care programs must follow the standards found in the “Child Care Facility Handbook,” October 2017, incorporated herein by reference.

Rulemaking Authority 402.281 FS. Law Implemented 402.281 FS. History–New 5-1-08, Amended 1-13-10, 8-1-13, 7-7-15, 10-25-17, 6-12-19.
65C-22.010 Enforcement.
This rule establishes the grounds under which the Department shall issue an administrative fine, deny, suspend, revoke a license or registration or place a licensee or registrant on probation status as well as uniform system of procedures to impose disciplinary sanctions.
(1) Definitions.
(a) “Day” means a weekday, excluding weekends and holidays.
(b) “Probation” is a licensing status indicating the license is in jeopardy of being revoked or not renewed due to violations of licensing standards. Probation may require the licensee to comply with specific conditions intended to ensure that the licensee comes into and maintains compliance with licensing standards. Examples of such conditions are: a deadline to remedy an existing violation, a specified period during which compliance with licensing standards must be strictly maintained; and specified conditions under which the facility must operate during the probationary period.
(c) “Standards” are requirements for the operation of a licensed facility provided in statute or in rule.
(d) “Technical Assistance” means a Department offer of assistance to a licensee or registrant to correct the statutory or regulatory violations.
(e) “Violation” means noncompliance with a licensing standard as described in an inspection report resulting from an inspection under section 402.311, F.S., as follows with regard to Class I, Class II, and Class III Violations.
1. “Class I Violation” is an incident of noncompliance with a Class I standard as described on CF-FSP Form 5316, May 2019 Child Care Facility Standards Classification Summary and CF-FSP Form 5427, May 2019, School-Age Child Care Facility Standards Classification Summary, which are incorporated by reference. Copies of the CF-FSP Form 5316 and CF-FSP Form 5427 may be obtained from the Department’s website at www.myflfamilies.com/childcare or from the following links: http://www.flrules.org/Gateway/reference.asp?No=Ref-10471 and http://www.flrules.org/Gateway/reference.asp?No=Ref-10473. However, any violation of a Class II standard that results in death or serious harm to a child shall escalate to a Class I violation. The effective date of a termination of a provider’s Gold Seal Quality Care designation is the date of the Department’s written notification to the provider. However, any violation of a Class II standard that results in death or serious harm to a child shall escalate to a Class I violation. Class I violations are the most serious in nature.
2. “Class II Violation” is an incident of noncompliance with an individual Class II standard as described on CF-FSP Form 5316. Class II violations are less serious in nature than Class I violations.
3. “Class III Violation” is an incident of noncompliance with an individual Class III standard as described on CF-FSP Form 5316. Class III violations are less serious in nature than either Class I or Class II violations.
(2) Disciplinary Sanctions.
(a) Enforcement of disciplinary sanctions for all Class I violations and for repeated Class II and Class III violations shall be applied progressively for each standard violation. The document entitled, Reconciliation of 2012 and 2017 Child Care Facility Classification Summaries, CF-FSP Form 5420, October 2017, which is incorporated into this rule, provides an alignment of the 2012 and 2017 Child Care Facility Classification Summaries for purposes of progressive enforcement. A copy of the CF-FSP Form 5420 may be obtained from the Department’s website or from the following link: http://www.flrules.org/Gateway/reference.asp?No=Ref-08741. In addition, providers will be offered technical assistance in conjunction with all violations. The classification of standard violations within the Child Care Facility Standards Classification Summary and the progressive disciplinary actions prescribed for each class by this rule are based on the provisions of Section 402.310(1)(b), FS.
(b) A grace period is provided, wherein a violation of a standard that has occurred more than two years prior to a subsequent violation of the same standard will not be counted for purposes of progressive discipline. However, for the purposes of continued licensure or registration, the program’s violation history will be considered. A violation that has been withdrawn by the Department or has been dismissed as the result of an administrative proceeding held pursuant to chapter 120, F.S., contesting an administrative complaint will not be counted for purposes of progressive discipline. A violation that is only reflected in an inspection report does not relieve the Department of its burden to prove that violation for purposes of progressive discipline upon the alleged occurrence of a subsequent violation.
(c) Failure to submit a completed CF-FSP Form 5017, Application for a License to Operate a Child Care Facility, which is incorporated by reference in paragraph 65C-22.001(1)(a), F.A.C., for renewal of an annual license at least 45 days prior to the expiration date of the current license constitutes a licensing violation. The Department shall impose an administrative fine of $50.00 for the first occurrence, $100.00 for the second occurrence, and $200.00 for each subsequent occurrence within a five year period.
(d) Disciplinary sanctions for licensing violations shall be progressively enforced as follows:
1. Class I Violations.
a. For the first and second violation of a Class I standard, the Department shall, upon applying the factors in section 402.310(1), F.S., impose a fine not less than $100.00 nor more than $500.00 per day for each violation, and may impose other disciplinary sanctions in addition to the fine.
b. For the third and subsequent violation of a Class I standard, the Department shall suspend, deny or revoke the license. The Department, upon applying the factors in section 402.310(1), F.S., may also impose a fine not less than $100.00 nor more than $500.00 per day for each violation in addition to any other disciplinary sanction.
2. Class II Violations.
a. For the second violation of the same Class II standard, the Department shall impose an administrative fine of $50.00 for each such violation.
b. For the third violation of the same Class II standard, the Department shall impose an administrative fine of $60.00 per day for each such violation.
c. For the fourth violation of the same Class II standard, the Department shall place the provider’s license on probation status for a period not to exceed six months, and shall also impose a fine of $75.00 per day for each such violation.
d. For the fifth and subsequent violation of the same Class II standard, the Department shall suspend, deny, or revoke the license, and shall also impose an administrative fine of $100.00 per day for each such violation.
3. Class III Violations.
a. For the third violation of the same Class III standard, the Department shall impose an administrative fine of $25.00 for each such violation.
b. For the fourth violation of the same Class III standard, the Department shall impose an administrative fine of $30.00 per day for each such violation.
c. For the fifth violation of the same Class III standard, the Department shall place the provider’s license on probation status for a period not to exceed six months, and shall also impose an administrative fine of $40.00 per day for each such violation. However, for the fifth violation of a Children’s Health and Immunization standard, the Department will not place the provider’s license on probation status.
d. For the sixth and subsequent violation of a Class III standard, the Department shall suspend, deny, or revoke the license, and the Department shall also impose an administrative fine of $50.00 per day for each such violation. However, for the sixth and subsequent violation of the same Class III Children’s Health and Immunization standard, the Department will place the provider’s license or registration on probation status for a period not to exceed six months in lieu of suspending, denying, or revoking the license or registration.
(3) When the Department has reasonable cause to believe that grounds exist for the denial, suspension, or revocation of a license or registration, the conversion of a license or registration to probation status, or the imposition of an administrative fine, it shall determine the matter in accordance with procedures prescribed in chapter 120, F.S. Imposition of an administrative fine shall be accomplished through an administrative complaint. Denial of a license or registration or conversion to probationary status pursuant to section 402.310, F.S., may be accomplished through an administrative complaint or a notice of intent to deny a pending renewal application.
