The chairperson or chief executive officer of the governing body shall complete a statement of responsibility on behalf of the governing body acknowledging the same in connection with any application for License or Permit on a form provided by the Department. If the Center is individually owned, then the owner(s) will complete the statement of responsibility.
(a) Application for License. Prior to filing for licensure, an applicant shall attend an orientation of no more than 16 hours that has been approved by the Department. This orientation shall, at a minimum, provide instruction on the application process and give an overview of the Department's regulations that relate to the operation of early child care learning centers.

Prior to the issuance of an initial License, the Director of a Center responsible for its day- to-day operations shall have completed a 40-hour director's training course that has been approved by the Department. At a minimum, the subject matter taught at a Director's training course shall cover the areas of administrator competencies that serve as a framework for professional development, which include, but are not limited to, early learning standards, business management, communication, developmentally appropriate practices, professional and leadership development, and advocacy for the Center, Parents, children and Staff.
(c) No person shall operate a Center without a License or Permit. A separate License or Permit is required for each address or location at which a Center is proposed to be operated even when all of the proposed Centers are owned by the same person or entity. A separate License or Permit is also required for each Center operated at a single location by the same governing body.
1. Temporary License. The Department may at its discretion issue a temporary License if the health and safety of the children to be served by the Center will not be endangered. A temporary License will be valid for a specified period not to exceed one (1) year and may be issued when the Center is not in full compliance with these rules but has demonstrated satisfactory evidence that it is making progress toward meeting these rules and has submitted an acceptable Plan of Correction.
2. Restricted License. The Department may at its discretion issue a restricted License in lieu of a temporary or regular License. The restricted License may be granted either in connection with the initial application process for a License or Permit or as a result of a subsequent determination made by the Department concerning compliance with these rules. The restriction shall appear on the face of the License and shall restrict a Center from providing care or services which are beyond the capability of the License Holder to provide. The restriction may also limit the number and/or age of the children served by the Center.
3. Regular License. A License will be issued upon presentation of evidence satisfactory to the Department that the Center is in compliance with applicable statutes and these rules. The License is valid for one year unless voluntarily surrendered by the holder, reduced to a restricted or temporary License or suspended or revoked by the Department.

In order to obtain or retain a License or Permit, the Director of the Center and its Employees must be qualified as defined in these rules to administer or work in a Center. The Department may presume that the Director and Employees are qualified subject to a satisfactory
DECAL 28 Rules for Child Care Learning Centers

 DECAL 29 Rules for Child Care Learning Centers
Comprehensive Records Check Determination. However, the Department may require additional reasonable verification of the qualifications of the Director and Employees either at the time of application for a License or Permit or at any time during the License or Permit period whenever the Department has reason to believe that a Director or Center Employee is not qualified under these rules to administer or work in a Child Care Learning Center. Reasonable verification which may be required by the Department may include, but need not be limited to, any or all of the following: statement(s) from an attending physician or other health care professionals attesting to the mental and/or physical health of the applicant and/or staff member; letters of reference from designated persons in the community where the applicant and/or staff member intends to work or is working; certified copies of court orders and additional criminal records checks.
(d) License or Permit is Non-transferable. A License or Permit to operate a Child Care Learning Center is not transferable in any way. Each License and Permit shall be returned to the Department immediately upon the expiration, suspension, revocation, restriction of the License or Permit or closure or termination of the operation.

If an emergency situation arises which makes it impossible to give thirty (30) days' notice, the management of the Center shall notify the Department by telephone and shall submit an application for an amended License as soon as management becomes aware of the change that will be necessitated by the emergency situation. In no case, however, shall a new owner operate the Center without first securing a new License or Permit from the Department.
(f) False or Misleading Information. The application for a License or Permit, including the Records Check Application, must be truthfully and fully completed. In the event that the Department has reason to believe that the application has not been completed truthfully, it may require additional verification of the facts alleged. The Department may refuse to issue a License or Permit where false statements have been made in connection with the application or any other documents required by the Department.
(g) E-mail Contact Information. Each Center issued or applying for a License or Permit in the state of Georgia shall provide the Department e-mail contact information ("Contact Information") so that this agency may contact the Center and send information to the Center via e-mail. It shall be the Center's responsibility to maintain correct contact information, to update the Department if contact information changes, and to respond timely to information requests from the Department transmitted to the provided e-mail address. Delivery of any such information, including but not limited to directives, bulletins, data requests, notices of proposed amendments to rules and regulations, and any other matters affecting Centers, to said e-mail address shall be considered valid so long as the Department does not receive a failure to deliver message.
(h) Permit. The Department may issue a Permit for a program to operate without a License for a limited term in situations, such as but not limited to, a change of ownership.

 DECAL 30 Rules for Child Care Learning Centers

The Department may, at its discretion, grant waivers and variances of specific rules upon application or petition being filed on forms provided by the Department. The Department may establish conditions which must be met by the Center in order to operate under the waiver or variance granted. Waivers and variances may be granted in accordance with the following considerations:
(a) Variance. A variance may be granted upon a showing by the applicant or petitioner that the particular rule or regulation that is the subject of the variance request should not be applied as written because strict application of the rule would cause undue hardship. The applicant or petitioner must also show that adequate standards affording protection for the health, safety and care of the children exist and will be met in lieu of the exact requirements of the rule or regulation in question.
(b) Waiver. The Department may dispense entirely with the enforcement of a rule or regulation by granting a waiver upon a showing by the applicant or petitioner that the purpose of the rule or regulation is met through equivalent standards affording equivalent protection for the health, safety and care of the children.
(c) Experimental Variance or Waiver. The Department may grant waivers and variances to allow experimentation and demonstration of new and innovative approaches to delivery of services upon a showing by the applicant or petitioner that the intended protections afforded by the rule or regulation which is the subject of the request are met and that the innovative approach has the potential to improve service delivery.
