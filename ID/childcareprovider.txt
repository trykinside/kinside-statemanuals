Introduction
This manual has been developed by the staff at the public health district as a reference tool for many different situations and covers basic information needed to operate a childcare operation in a manner that will protect the health and safety of the children being cared for and help control illnesses within the childcare facility.
Being chosen to care for a family’s children is a big responsibility for any childcare facility, from the smallest of family home settings to the largest childcare centers in the area. The public health districts conduct health and safety inspections for all childcare facilities in Idaho. The Department of Health and Welfare, some cities, and the Idaho Child Care Program require health and safety inspections as part of the licensing/registration process. The role of the health district is an outreach and educational approach to obtain childcare provider compliance with the health and safety regulations governing the childcare programs.
Topics such as food safety; communicable disease guidelines; immunization requirements and record reviews; poison prevention and toxic storage; hand-washing; diaper changing procedures; hygienic practices; sanitizer usage and formulation; fire code requirements; play/nap areas; first aid/CPR requirements; child-staff ratios; and some diseases are all covered in this handbook.
Complaint inspections/investigations are also conducted by the health district and may be done by any one of the health district’s Environmental Health Specialists or Nurses.
If you have received this manual, you more than likely received it during a visit from the Districts Childcare Inspection Program staff.
An excellent source of information concerning health and safety is this reference:
CARING FOR OUR CHILDREN
National Health and Safety Performance Standards Guidelines for Early Childcare and Education Programs
 1

Child Care Guidelines
Age & Health of Provider / Supervision (1)
The owner or operator and all staff are responsible for the direct care, protection, supervision, and guidance of children through active involvement or direct observation. Provider must be 18 years old or older. Persons 16 or 17 may provide care if directly supervised by a provider. A caregiver must not work when ill as per Rules and Regulations Governing Idaho Reportable Diseases.
CPR/First Aid Training (2)
There must be at least ONE adult on premises at all times who has a current certification in pediatric rescue breathing and first aid treatment from a certified instructor. Additional staff may be required to have CPR and First Aid Training when they are transporting children to and from the child care facility. There must be a trained adult present with children during all hours of operation. Be sure to take a CPR and First Aid course that is approved for child care in Idaho.
Child- Staff Ratio (3)
Child to staff ratio must be adhered to during all hours of operation. Ratios are determined by a point system. Points are determined by the age of children. 12 points per staff member is the maximum. Zero to less than 24 months is equal to 2 points. 24 months to under 36 months is equal to 1 1/2 points. 36 months to under 5 years old is equal to 1 point. 5 years old to under 13 years of age is equal to a 1⁄2 point. Local jurisdictions (cities) that require child care licensing may have more stringent requirements.
Staff/Children Excluded When Ill (4)
Provide a written procedure that outlines what will be done if a child becomes ill while in your care. This procedure must address:
a. Keeping the child separated from the rest of the children to prevent spreading disease.
b. Not allowing children to attend if they have had diarrhea, vomiting, or a fever (101° oral, 102° rectal, 100° axillary (armpit), accompanied by behavior changes or other signs or symptoms of illness within a 24-hour
period.
c. Notification of a parent or guardian.
According to IDAPA16.02.10 Rules and Regulations Governing Idaho Reportable Diseases, staff or children who are diagnosed with a day care restrictable disease must not attend a day care facility as long as the disease is in communicable form. Caregivers must follow IDAPA 16.02.10 080. Day Care Facility-Reporting and Control Measures
Immunization Records (5)
Idaho Code 39-1118 requires that each child’s immunization record or reason for exemption is provided to the operator within fourteen (14) days of initial attendance. Provide information about immunizations to parents. Accurate and current records are required to be on the premises during all hours of operation.
Go to this web page for the most current immunization schedule:
http://www.immunize.org/cdc/schedules/
Disaster and Emergency Planning and Communication (6)
Providers shall have documented policies and procedures for emergencies resulting from a natural disaster or a man-caused event that include and not limited to:
a. Evacuation, relocation, shelter-in-place, lock-down procedures, and procedures for communication and re- unification with families, continued business operational plan, and accommodation of infants, toddlers, children with disabilities, and children with chronic medical conditions.
b. Procedures for staff and volunteer emergency preparedness training and drills.
c. Guidelines for the continuation of child care services in the period following the emergency or disaster.
If you need assistance, contact a Child Care Health Consultant with IdahoSTARS by calling the Idaho CareLine 2- 1-1.
 2

A functional telephone or cell phone is required. Parent or guardian must have access to the phone in case of an emergency. Post the name and address of the facility, 911, Idaho CareLine 2-1-1 and other emergency numbers for quick reference.

Food Contact Surfaces/Sanitizing (13)
Food contact surfaces must be kept clean (counters, tables, high chairs, cutting boards) and sanitized with a solution of chlorine 50-200 ppm or quaternary ammonium chloride 200 ppm. Obtain test strips to determine correct concentration. Have the correct test paper to determine the concentration of the sanitizer.
SANITIZING SOLUTION MIXTURE
MIX: 1 tablespoon bleach in each gallon of warm water. Use unscented liquid bleach, such as Clorox, Purex, etc. Note: Mix 3/4 teaspoon to 1 quart of water. This dilution will give you the maximum amount (200 ppm) of desired sanitizer concentration. This mixture is for bleach with 5.25% - 6% sodium hypochlorite. Read the information about the active ingredient on the container label.
OTHER SANITIZING CLEANERS
Chemicals and sanitizing cleaners other than bleach are allowed ONLY if the label states it is a sanitizer or disinfectant suitable for food contact surfaces and registered with the EPA. Label directions for use must be followed.
• Cutting boards, knives, counters, pots and pans, plates, bottles, cups, forks, and spoons must be clean and sanitized, in good repair, smooth, and easy to clean.

Day Care Licensure
Who Needs a Day Care License
Idaho Code 39-1102 Basic Day Care License and 39-1103 Licensing Authority requires individuals providing care for thirteen or more children to be licensed. Centers and Group Day Care facilities are required to be licensed which includes a Health and Safety inspection, Fire Safety inspection and criminal history check according to Idaho Code. A Basic Day Care License is optional for Family Day Care according to Idaho Code.
There are three basic categories in which childcare facilities are placed.
A. Care Center: A facility that cares for 13 or more children.
B. Group Day Care: A home or facility that cares for 7 to 12 children. C. Family Day Care: A home that cares for six or fewer children.
Starting the Day Care Licensing Process
To begin the day care licensing process, contact either the Department of Health and Welfare or your local licensing agency, whichever applies to the location of the facility. If applying to be an approved “Idaho Child Care Program (ICCP)” provider, contact the Child Care Resource Center in the appropriate district/county office. Both of the licensing agencies will have handouts, checklists, background checks, and fees for obtaining licensure. Each agency will require a background check and fingerprinting for all employees who will be caring for children, a fire inspection from the local Fire Marshall, CPR and first-aid certification, and a health and safety inspection from the local health department.
Licensure Requirements and Fees
The following requirements and fees are applied to all licensed childcare facilities. Local jurisdictions may require licensure or have requirements for a child care business. Inquire with your local municipality or county about licensing and fees before starting child care. Inquire with the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare about Day Care licensing fees.
Department of Health and Welfare (DHW) Licensure:
After contacting the DHW and initiating the licensure process, the health district staff will schedule the health and safety inspection upon receipt of a referral from Idaho Stars for both ICCP and State licensed facilities. Contact your local Fire Marshall to schedule a fire inspection. There may or may not be a fee associated with the fire inspection, depending on the fire district. Contact the DHW or licensing agency to obtain information about the criminal history background check requirements.
An Idaho Basic Day Care license is renewed every 24 months. There is a fee for a license issued by the DHW or local licensing agency. A new health and safety inspection from the health district is required at the time of licensing renewal. Waiting until the last minute to send in the application and fees may result in licensure expiration prior to having the health and safety inspection completed.
The Idaho CareLine 2-1-1 is the best place to find the right people to speak to about the licensing process and the Idaho Child Care Program. A new fire inspection is required each time there is a license renewal.
The Idaho Child Care Program (ICCP) Registration:
Childcare providers wishing to provide childcare for low income families may register as an ICCP provider, either in addition to their normal licensing or just as an ICCP provider. There is no cost associated with registering as an ICCP provider. Do not call to make an appointment for a health and safety inspection. The health department will conduct an inspection after receiving a referral or Health District Renewal List from IdahoSTARS.
It is very important that you submit all of the required information to IdahoSTARS. IdahoSTARS will only send a referral notice to the health department to conduct a health inspection after the necessary documents are submitted. If you have questions about the process contact the Idaho CareLine 2-1-1 and ask to speak to a vendor specialist who can answer your question about the requirements.

Relative Child Care
This is a home in which a relative (over 18 years of age) is caring only for her/his grandchildren, nieces, and nephews.
Outdoor Safety
Toddlers and Two’s:
Have a separate play area for younger preschoolers featuring equipment for their size and needs. Climbers and climbing toys should be low to the ground.
Swings should be low and have special toddler seats that support the child’s whole body. When swings are fully extended they should be 6 feet from any structure.
Slides should have high sides and should not be steep. Steps should be wide and low. There should be large platforms at the tops of the steps so there is room to sit down and turn around. Metal slides should face north or be shaded from the sun.
Wood chips (shredded bark) or pea gravel cushioning surfaces offer too many tempting objects to taste. A commercially produced cushioning surface or 9-12 inches of sand is more appropriate for this age group.
Threes, fours, and fives:
Children can resort to dangerous acts out of boredom. They need well designed, interesting equipment that offers a varied physical workout; jumping, swinging, climbing, balancing, crawling through tunnels, etc.
 10

Playing Safe in the Sun
Keep infants younger than six months out of direct sunlight. Find shade under a tree, umbrella or the stroller canopy.
Children should always wear sunscreen with a minimum of SPF factor of 15.
Stay out of the sun during the time when UV levels are higher, generally between 10:00 a.m. and 2:00 p.m. Wear shatter resistant sunglasses with 99% UV protection to protect eyes from UV rays.
Use hats, umbrellas and other means of shading from the sun.
Avoid water activities during the hot part of the day, as water reflects the sun’s light and increases the chance of sunburn.
Keep children well hydrated by providing water several times a day.

1. A fence (minimum 6 feet high) protects children from potentially hazardous areas (e.g. streets). There must be two exits and gates that can be secured. Water features (e.g. pools, spa, irrigation) require a fence 4 feet high.
              2. The area is free of electrical hazards (e.g. unfenced air conditioners switchboxes, and power lines).
              3. The area is free of debris (e.g. broken glass, rocks, garbage).
                       4. There are no poisonous substances such as poisonous plants, poisonous berries, mushrooms, animal feces.
     5. The sandbox or sand play area is covered when not in use.
                       6. A sprinkler or hose is used for water play (to prevent drowning, diseases passed through water).
     7. 9-12 inches of non-compacted sand, pea gravel, shredded wood, or equivalent materials is in place under and around all climbing and moving equipment.

Guidelines for Toy Safety
Toys should be a source of fun and learning for children. Too often, toys with poor design, toys that are old, used incorrectly, or toys in bad repair can lead to serious, even fatal
injuries. A major area of consideration for all toys is the durability
and safety of the toys. Toys should be constructed to withstand the
uses and abuses of children in the age range for which the toy is appropriate.
Safe Toys for Young Children Should Be:
• Well-made (no sharp points or splinters)
• Painted with non-toxic, lead free paint
• Shatter proof
• Easily cleaned
• Durable
• Not porous
• Not electric or battery operated
• Checked frequently for safety
• Devoid of button eyes or small parts that can come off
• Kept out of reach of very young or inappropriate age groups
• Non-flammable
Check Your Toys for These Hazards!
• Airborne toys
• Sharp points, jagged edges, rough surfaces
• Nuts, bolts, and clamps that are loose
• Sharp spikes or pins that have become exposed when your child pulled the toy apart
• Squawker or other noisemakers that are not securely attached to the toy and that could be removed or swallowed
• Battery toys with frayed or loose wires
• Any electrical wiring should be labeled “UL Approved.”
• Small detachable parts that could be swallowed or stuck in the throat, nose or ears
For children under three years of age, a small part should be at least 11⁄4 inches in diameter and 2 1⁄4 inches long. Any part smaller than this is a potential health hazard. If it fits in a 35mm film canister, it is too small for a three- year-old.
What a Child Care Provider Can Do
• Look and read age and safety labels on toys.
• Explain and/or show the child how to use toys properly and safely.
• Keep toys intended for older children away from younger children who can be injured.
• Check all toys periodically for breakage and potential hazards – damaged or dangerous toys should be repaired or thrown away immediately.
 13

• Store toys safely – teach children to put toys away so they are not tripping hazards, and check shelves for safety. Toy boxes are not recommended due to suffocation and falling lids.

Consumer Product Safety
Dear Child Care Owner or Manager:
The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) is an independent federal regulatory agency that was created in 1972 by Congress in order to “protect the public against unreasonable risks of injuries and deaths associated with consumer products.” You may be familiar with CPSC already because of our recalls of children’s toy sand other products, like cribs and playpens.
CPSC estimates that during 1997 about 31,000 children, 4 years old and younger were treated in U.S. hospital emergency rooms for injuries at child care/school settings. CPSC is aware of at least 56 children who have died in child care settings since 1990. In a recent national study, CPSC staff visited a number of child care settings and found that 2/3 of them had one or more potentially serious hazards. The study also showed 5% were using products that had been recalled by CPSC.
To help remedy the situation, CPSC has prepared a Child Care Safety Checklist for child care providers and parents use. The checklist will help caregivers become informed about hidden hazards by giving them a list of things to look for to make their homes and child care setting safer for children. Parents can use the checklist when choosing child care setting and ensuring that the child care provider is vigilant in monitoring product recall announcements and removing dangerous items. A representative should provide a copy of this checklist for you.
Your local health department is working with CPSC to ensure child care facilities within your state are aware of potential dangers and to assist you in identifying how to help prevent injuries and ensure greater safety for children.
Additional copies of the checklist along with other pertinent information can be obtained by accessing CPSC through its website www.cpsc.gov. It is highly recommended that you visit this site often. You can perform the following activities on the website.
• Get CPSC’s recall notices and other safety information automatically by subscribing to e-mail list.
• Check the recalls part of this web site for information on products recalled from 1989 to the present.
• Call CPSC’s toll-free hotline, (800) 638-2772, for information on product recalls from 1973 to 1989.
For more information about children’s safety and recalls of children’s toys and products contact, Toll Free Hotline: (800) 638-2772 or U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, Washington DC 20207
Thank you.

Infant Safe Sleep Practices – English
      Infant Safe Sleep Practices
Tip Sheet for Idaho Child Care Providers
Federal law, and ICCP program rules, focus on promoting safe sleep practices for infants (0-12 months old) that reduce the risk of SIDS/SUID (Sudden Infant Death Syndrome/Sudden Unexplained Infant Death). These practices should be observed at all times, and will be required to successfully complete required health and safety inspections for all ICCP participating providers.
 Follow current American Academy of Pediatrics recommendations concerning safe sleep practices including SIDS/SUIDS risk reduction.
 Supervise napping or sleeping children.
o Child care providers must be within sight or hearing of the children at all times, including nap
time, and must be available and able to immediately assist a child in an emergency.
 Supervision by sight and hearing is always recommended.
o Napping children who are not within sight of a staff member, must always be within easy
hearing distance.
o All children (including the provider’s children), asleep or awake, count towards ratio
requirements.
o Video equipment or baby monitors are not a substitute for supervision or monitoring.
 All cribs, bassinets, “play pens,” and “pack-n-plays” must be in good repair and approved by the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) as infant/toddler sleep devices.
o Bouncers, swings, car seats, hammocks, boxes, Boppy’s, Bumbos, and Dock-a-Tots are NOT
acceptable sleep devices.
o If a child falls asleep in a device or location that is not acceptable for sleep, the child must be
moved to CPSC approved sleep device.
o Mattresses must fit snugly and be made specifically for the size crib in which they are placed. o Bed linens used under children on cots, cribs, and playpens must be tight-fitting.
 Place an infant to sleep on their back, on a flat sleep surface.
o If an infant turns over while sleeping, the child care provider must return the infant to his or her
back until the infant is able to independently roll from back to front and front to back.
 This developmental skill should be easily observed when an infant is awake or asleep.
o If there is a medical requirement for a child to be in any other sleep position, a physician’s note
(on professional letterhead with contact information for the medical doctor) must be on file at the facility, and made available to the inspector.
 A note from a physician is not an exclusion of liability for a child care provider.
Revised 5/2018 - AVM
   16

      Sufficiently light the room to be able to observe skin color in case of changes.
o Monitor children’s breathing patterns through visual observation, and note any changes.
 Allow infants to follow their own sleep patterns.
o Infants need to sleep when they are tired and not according to a schedule determined by the
early learning provider.
 Do not allow loose blankets, stuffed toys, pillows, crib bumpers, or similar items inside a crib.
o Infant sleep clothing, such as sleep sacks or pajamas, may be used to keep infants warm.
o After an infant first exhibits signs of attempting to roll (around 3 months old), swaddling must
not be used.
 The use of sleep sacks is recommended if swaddling is practiced.
 Swaddling should be snug around the chest but allow ample room at the hips and knees to
avoid hip dislocation or hip dysplasia.
 Items that pose a strangulation, fall, or entrapment hazard must be kept well out of an infant’s reach while in the crib, bassinet, or other approved sleep equipment.
o Carefully consider the placement of electrical cords, cords for blinds and shades, lamps, baby
monitors, blankets, televisions, toys, blankets, towels, wall hangings, pictures, etc. to ensure
that there is no way a child could reach them from their sleep location.
o Do not use strings to hang any object (mobile, toy, diaper bag, etc.), on or near the crib.
o Pacifiers may be used. However, pacifiers should not be clipped, pinned, or tied to an infant’s
clothing, and they should not be tied around an infant’s neck, wrist, or other body part.
 Do not allow a blanket or any other item to cover or drape over an occupied crib, bassinet, or other equipment where infants commonly sleep.
o Items draped over a crib impair an early learning provider’s ability to see and hear the infant. o Draped items could fall on top of infant creating a risk of suffocation or entanglement.
 Do not allow clothing to cover any portion of an infant’s head or face while sleeping, and readjust these items when necessary.
o Clothing covering an infant’s head could impact their ability to breathe.
 Prevent infants from getting too warm while sleeping. It is a good practice to dress an infant in one more layer of clothing than you are wearing to be comfortable in the same environment.
o Signs that an infant is too warm or in distress include, but are not limited to:
 Sweating
 A sudden rise in temperature
 Flushed, pale, or hot and dry skin, warm to the touch  Vomiting
 Refusing to drink
 Depressed fontanelle (“soft spot”)
 Irritability

Plants That Poison
Poisonous plants, household cleaners, and medicine are the three most common causes of accidental poisoning in children under 5 years old. The chart following shows the most commonly found poisonous plants in the Midwestern area of the United States.
This is not a complete list. All plants listed as deadly in bold type are very poisonous and may cause death if eaten.
Many mushrooms can be deadly. It is often hard to know which mushrooms are safe to eat, so it is best to not eat any wild mushrooms.
Two other poisonous plants not pictured in the chart are Holly berries and Mistletoe berries. This chart does not include poisonous seeds or plants causing skin rashes, such as Poison Ivy.
Call your doctor or Poison Control Center at once if you think your child has eaten any of these poisonous plants.
How to Prevent Plant Poisoning:
1. Teach your children never to put plants, plant parts, berries, or mushroom in their mouths.
2. Know the names of your house and garden plants, and which ones are poisonous.
3. Put poisonous houseplants, bulbs, and seeds up high where children cannot reach them.
4. Do not think a plant is not poisonous because birds and other animals eat them.
5. Cooking plants does not always destroy poisons in the plant.
6. Call your doctor or Poison Control Center if a child eats anything poisonous. Always have a bottle of
Syrup of IPECAC at home.
7. Keep a sample of the plant.
Children are often attracted to the colorful berries, flowers, fruits, and leaves of plants, but more than 700 typical plants in the United States and Canada have been identified as poisonous. Most of these poisonings can be prevented. If eaten, some plant parts can cause a skin rash or upset stomach; others can even cause death.
CHILDREN HAVE DIED FROM EATING THESE PLANTS.
• Keep all plants away from small children.
• Teach children never to eat unknown plants.
• If you think a child may have eaten part of a poisonous plant, remove any remaining pieces of the plant from child’s mouth. Bring a piece of the plant to the phone.
• Phone Poison Control Center before treating a child who has eaten a plant. Follow their directions.
• Keep an un-expired bottle of Syrup of IPECAC in a locked place if your policy allows. Use it only if
the Poison Control Center tells you to make a child vomit.
Pesticides and Fertilizers
Fertilizers and pesticides used for gardens and lawns are toxic. They can remain active for several days. Contact with them can cause rashes, asthma attacks, headaches, or nausea.
Children take in the toxins by breathing the vapors, by absorbing them through their skin, or by eating something that has been contaminated.
After an application, keep children off the grass and out of the bushes for about three days. (Some residues still remain).

Guidelines for Food Preparation and Handling
The following discussion regarding proper handling of food is not intended to replace the existing food regulation, but to give the child care center operator a brief insight into some of the criteria necessary to prevent a food- associated disease outbreak. It is the operator’s responsibility to contact the health department to obtain the necessary permits prior to opening for business.
Improper preparation, handling, and storage of food have been associated with children becoming ill while attending child care centers. For this reason, child care center operators must be aware of acceptable methods of preparing, handling, and storing food items in order to reduce the possibility of having children become ill from improperly handled food.
Food Source
Source of the food is one of the most important items to be considered in a food establishment. Only food from a health department approved source may be served. No home prepared foods, particularly home canned products and wild game may be served in licensed facilities. Food from non-inspected or unapproved sources may be the cause for creating a food borne disease outbreak. Raw milk or reconstituted powdered milk may not be served. If milk is served, it must be Grade A.
Food Temperature
Improper temperature of food is the single most important item causing food borne illness outbreaks. It is imperative to maintain proper temperatures of all foods in order to prevent the multiplication of bacteria. If a food is served hot, it must be cooked to the appropriate temperature and held at a temperature of not less than 135 ̊F. If food is served or stored cold, it must be kept at a temperature of less than 41 ̊F. If a food is frozen, it must be thawed under refrigeration, as part of the cooking process, or under cold running water. Thawing food at room temperature is prohibited.
• A thermometer shall be provided in the refrigerator. Keep the temperature at 41 ̊F or less.
• Once food has been served to an individual, it is not acceptable to re-serve any unused portion.
Hygienic Infection Control Practices
Good hygienic infection control practices are essential to any food operation in order to limit the spread of communicable disease. Food hygienic practices must include washing hands when they become soiled. Hand washing is extremely important after using the restroom, changing diapers, and after smoking.
• Individual single-service paper towels shall be provided in toilet room and kitchen.
• Persons with open infected wounds, coughs, colds, sore throats, or other upper respiratory infections
shall be restricted from working in the food operation.
• No person shall handle children or prepare food if they have a communicable disease.
• Individually marked cups, paper cups, or a drinking fountain shall be provided for the children’s drinking. If marked cups are used, they should be stored in such a fashion that children cannot handle cups other than their own.
• Water shall come from a health department approved source; drinking fountains must be an approved design.
Sanitization of Multi-Use Utensils
All multi-use utensils should be washed with hot soapy water and rinsed in clear water, and sanitized by immersion in a water solution containing at least 50 ppm available chlorine or by bringing the surface temperature of the utensil to at least 160 ̊ F. Have test strips on hand to measure the concentration and insure it is the correct amount of sanitizer when using household bleach.
23

Three sinks shall be required to wash, rinse, and sanitize dishes. A home-based child care may use a two- compartment sink and a plastic tub containing 1 tablespoon of unscented (5% sodium hypochlorite) household bleach per gallon of water.
Home dishwashers with a sanitizing cycle are recommended in place of the sink.
Once utensils are clean, they must be stored in a manner that will prevent contamination by insects or rodents. Pots and pans should be nested on shelves upside down. All small utensils such as knives, forks, spoons, spatulas, etc. should be stored inside clean drawers in an orderly fashion.
Single service items such as paper plates and plastic utensils must be stored in such a manner to protect them from being contaminated. The reuse of single-service disposable utensils is unacceptable even if they have been subjected to the dishwashing process.
Storage Containers
Garbage containers should be watertight. Garbage containers should be kept covered when not in use to prevent entrance of insects. Outside garbage containers should be stored a minimum of 50 feet from the building.
Outside garbage cans shall be durable and have tight fitting lids. Inside garbage cans shall not be accessible to children (toddlers to 2 1/2 years).
Floors, Ceilings, and Walls
Floors, ceilings, and walls should be constructed of durable, smooth, easily cleanable, and light-colored materials. High-use surfaces (countertops and tables) can be kept cleaner and will not provide a place for bacteria or insects to feed if built of smooth, non-absorbent, durable material.
Bathrooms shall have no carpets around toilets or may have easy-to-clean throw rugs with non-slip backing on uncarpeted floors.
Pesticides, Cleaning Compounds, and Solvents
All toxic items, including cleaning compounds, pesticides, and solvents must be stored separately from food items, food preparation or food contact equipment. All toxic items must be kept in locked cupboards or stored out of reach of children.
The sewage disposal system must be working properly.
Dental Emergencies
First Aid Procedures
What would you do if a child broke a tooth? What should you do? Caregiver and teachers are sometimes faced with dental emergencies ranging from toothaches to broken teeth to canker sores. Following is a guideline to basic dental first aid procedures to follow until a dentist can be consulted.
Knocked Out Tooth
If a tooth is knocked out, find it, and place it in cold whole milk or water. Take the child and the tooth to the dentist immediately. DO NOT CLEAN THE TOOTH.
Broken or Displaced Tooth
Clean injured area with warm water. If injured area begins to swell, apply cold packs to outside of face. Take child to the dentist immediately.
Bitten Tongue or Lip
If bleeding occurs, apply pressure with clean cloth. If injured area begins to swell, apply cold packs. If bleeding does not stop or if bite is severe, take child to hospital emergency room.
24

Objects Wedged Between Teeth
Carefully remove object from between teeth with dental floss, if unable to remove, see a dentist. DO NOT remove any sharp object – see dentist immediately.
Possible Jaw Fracture
If jaw is broken or thought to be broken, do not move jaw. Wrap jaw with scarf, handkerchief, towel, etc. to immobilize the jaw and take child to hospital emergency room immediately.
Toothache
If a child has a toothache, rinse the mouth with warm water and floss teeth to remove any food particles. If swelling occurs, apply cold packs to outside of face area of swelling. DO NOT apply aspirin or other medications to aching tooth. Parent is recommended to take child to dentist.
Bleeding Gums
Bleeding gums are usually a result of poor oral hygiene. By removing plaque daily from the teeth and gums with a soft-bristled toothbrush and dental floss, the gum tissue should resume its normal condition. When red, swollen, or sore gums are present, rinse every 2 hours with a mixture of equal parts water and 3% solution of hydrogen peroxide or with warm saltwater solution. If this condition does not improve, a visit to the dentist is recommended.
Tooth Eruption Pain
Eruption of the permanent teeth is often accompanied by pain. Locate the eruption site and apply a cold pack to the exterior of face for temporary relief. A topical anesthetic such as Orabase with benzocaine, aspirin, or aspirin substitute may also be beneficial. DO NOT apply aspirin to gums. If pain persists, contact a dentist.
Cold Sores, Canker Sores, Fever Blisters
Determine if there is a cause for the irritation. Is it a broken dental appliance? Braces? For temporary relief, apply topical anesthetic such as Orabase with benzocaine and avoid hot spicy foods. An aspirin substitute may also be given for relief of pain or fever. DO NOT apply aspirin to sores. If sores are severe and not healed in 7-14 days and/or signs of fever and pain persist, contact a dentist.
25

Changing Diapers
NEVER leave a child unattended on diapering surfaces!
      1. CHECK to be sure supplies you need are ready. PLACE roll paper or disposable paper towels on diapering surface where the child will be.
2. PLACE child on disposable paper towel on diapering surface, taking care to hold him only with your hands if his diaper is soiled.
3. REMOVE soiled diaper and clothes. PUT disposable diapers in a plastic bag, or PUT soiled clothes in a plastic bag to be taken home.
4. CLEAN the child’s bottom with a pre-moistened disposable towelette or a damp paper towel. Then DISPOSE of the towelette or paper towel in the plastic bag or plastic-lined receptacle. REMOVE the disposable paper towel from beneath the child and dispose of it the same way.
5. WIPE your hands with a pre-moistened towelette or a damp paper towel. DISPOSE of it in the plastic bag or plastic-lined receptacle.
6. DIAPER or dress the child. Now you can hold him close to you.
7. WASH the child’s hands and return him to his crib or group.
8. CLEAN and DISINFECT the diapering area, and any equipment and supplies you touched. Then wash YOUR hands.
                                              CHECK all supplies before bringing the child to the diapering area. Read and follow the manufacturer’s label instructions for the proper use of the disinfectant.
• If a child has diarrhea, visible stool, urine, blood, or vomitus on outer clothing, place a disposable paper product on the diapering surface before starting the changing activities. Discard this paper in the soiled diaper container or plastic bag.
• If a child has diarrhea, or if visible stool, urine, or blood has soiled the diaper changer’s hands during the diapering activity, use a disposable moistened towelette to remove surface soiling from the hands before continuing changing activities, to prevent potential contamination.
• Commercial, moistened towelettes are often used to clean a child’s “bottom.” Discard used towelettes into plastic-lined containers intended for disposable diaper disposal. Caution: To prevent contamination, each child should have his own towelette container, labeled with his name.
• Following EVERY diaper change: the CHILD, regardless of age, must have his hands washed with liquid soap and running water before returning to new activities or the group. Towelettes are not recommended for routine hand washing practices. The ADULT must wash his hands with liquid soap, running water, and dry with a disposable paper towel or commercial air dryer. The hand washing sink, used for diapering activities, must never be the source for drinking water, food preparation, or for classroom activities.
• Gloves are recommended for diapering activities. When gloves are used, they must be removed and discarded following the removal of the soiled diaper and before rediapering the child, and/or before beginning any other activity.
• Discard used gloves into plastic lined containers intended for soiled disposable diapers. NEVER re-use gloves used to diaper a child for any purpose.
Cleaning and sanitizing (disinfecting) of diapering surfaces must be completed after every diaper change.
26

Components of a Diapering Area
• Establish one location for diapering activities. This area must never be used for classroom activities, food preparation, or for food or baby bottle storage.
• Diapering areas must be adjacent to a hand washing sink, supplied with running water, liquid soap, and disposable paper towels. A plastic-lined container with a tight fitting lid must be accessible for trash disposal from the hand washing activity. This sink may never be used as a source of drinking water, classroom activity water, or for food preparation water.
• Diapering tables must be constructed of
a strong, sturdy, smooth, seamless,
waterproof material which can be
sanitized (disinfected) after each diaper
change. The diapering surface must be free of breaks, chips, cracks or peeling, which prevents adequate sanitizing. Disease causing germs can grow in such conditions. A disposable paper towel surface cover may be used for each child; however, sanitizing must still occur after each change.
• Two water-proof, plastic-lined containers must be accessible to diaper changing personnel, one for soiled diaper disposal and one for soiled clothing storage. These containers must never be accessible to children. Soiled clothing must be placed in plastic bags, labeled with child’s name, and sent home for laundering unless the program has specific laundering policies which eliminate or strictly reduce the risk of contagious disease spread. NEVER place soiled clothing or diapers, etc. in children’s diaper bags which store or transport food or bottles or in compartments (cubbies) that house personal items such as toothbrushes, clean clothes, food, or bottles.
• Following each diaper change, the diapering surface must be cleaned and sanitized (disinfected) to kill germs that cause disease. Provide an adequate spray disinfection solution.
Following each diaper change, BOTH the CHILD and the ADULT involved with the diapering activity must wash their hands with liquid soap and running water, drying with a disposable paper towel.
 27

Disinfection Procedures
Germs can be found naturally on every surface and person in the child care facility. Since some germs can cause illness, disinfection is necessary to kill any harmful germs on toys, sleeping areas, blankets, eating utensils, clothing, diaper changing areas, food preparation counters, and other surfaces.
Body fluids such as blood, urine, feces, saliva, vomit, and pus can carry germs which cause disease. Proper cleaning and disinfection of surfaces in the facility help protect employees and children from these diseases. See information about properly selecting an appropriate sanitizer or disinfectant in the Resources section of this manual.
Protection for Yourself:
1. If you can, wear an apron to protect your clothes. Wear easy-to-wash clothes. Soiled clothing, towels, bedding, diapers, etc. must be kept out of reach of children.
2. Use gloves when cleaning or when coming into contact with body fluids.
3. Wash your hands after changing a diaper, coming into contact with body fluids, or handling soiled laundry.
Instructions:
Use disinfectants according to label instructions. Too weak a solution is ineffective; too concentrated a mixture can be dangerous, corrosive, and wastes money.
Household Bleach:
1-3 tablespoons per quart of water for most surfaces (door handles, faucets, crib rails, toys). For a blood spill mix 3 Tablespoons per quart of water.
1 Tablespoon of bleach per gallon for eating utensils, food preparation surfaces such as countertops, and cutting boards.
Laundry
Wash with soap and water; presoak heavily soiled clothing. Wash clothing or other materials heavily soiled with body fluids separately from other items. If the items are not bleachable, add non-chlorinated bleach to the wash cycle. Wash your hands after handling soiled laundry.
Hard-Surfaced Floors, Walls, and Counters
Wear gloves to wipe or blot up spills as much as possible. Wipe or mop the area with a germicidal detergent or bleach solution.
Mops, Gloves, Brushes, Sponges, and Cleaning Cloths
Must be disinfected after use. Rinse and store out of reach of children.
Carpets and Rugs
Use a sanitary absorbent powder, let dry and vacuum. These powders can be obtained at janitorial supply houses. OR: Wear gloves and blot up as much of the spill as possible. Use a brush and germicidal rug shampoo.
Toilet and Potty Chair
Wear gloves. Pour out the contents of potty-chair down the toilet. Scrub out the chair and/or toilet with disinfecting cleaner and let air dry.
Glasses Dishes, Eating Utensils, and Drinking
Wash in warm, soapy water. Rinse in clean water. Rinse in disinfecting solution. Air dry. Unscented household bleach is readily available and easy to use as a disinfectant. Sanitization concentration of disinfecting solution for food contact surfaces is to be 50-200 ppm chlorine, 200-400 ppm of quaternary ammonia compound. If another type of disinfectant is proposed, consult your health department.
28

Bleach Solutions
Chlorine bleach solutions are currently recommended for sanitizing disinfecting practices in early childhood settings. Household bleach is effective in killing many disease causing organisms. Chlorine bleach is an inexpensive product, which is easily accessible in every community. Chlorine bleach is used in very dilute solutions, allowing for repetitive sanitizing of items or surfaces which directly and indirectly go into the mouth. An EPA approved germicidal product may be used for sanitizing and disinfecting, however, caution must be used to prevent a toxic substance from accumulating or remaining on items such as mouthed toys, dishes, flatware, kitchen utensils, thermometers, table tops, or pacifiers.
CHLORINE BLEACH GUIDELINES
Bleach can irritate the skin, eyes, or lungs if used incorrectly. Call POISON CONTROL for appropriate management instructions if bleach has been swallowed or splashed in the eyes.
Cleaning and Sanitizing
Cleaning: Remove dirt, grease, debris, and many germs by washing or scrubbing with soap (detergent) and water and then rinsing the soapy area with fresh water.
Sanitizing/Disinfecting: To kill disease-causing germs on contact. This process is accomplished by the use of household bleach solutions, commercially prepared products (germicides), or physical agents such as high heat. The activity of sanitizing reduces the number of disease-causing germs to a “safe” level by using one of these methods:
• Household bleach must contain at least 5.25% sodium hypochlorite (active ingredient)
• Chlorine bleach concentrations may be 5.25% -8.25% sodium hypochlorite. Check the concentration
on the container. See table on page 30.
• Never mix bleach with toilet cleaners, solvents, rust removers, etc. Products containing ammonia or acid can release hazardous gases if mixed with bleach.
• Store bleach in the original container, away from heat, pilot lights, or direct sunlight.
• Never reuse bleach containers for liquids or food storage.
• Make spray solutions at least once each week. Daily is best.
• Clearly label the spray bottles with bleach solutions contents (use a permanent felt tip marker).
• Spray solutions kill many germs in a very short contact time.
• Soak solutions may take from 2 to 5 minutes to kill germs.
• OSHA guidelines include the use of 1:10 bleach and water for some infection control practices.
  29

BLEACH SOLUTIONS
READ THE CONCENTRATION (%) ON THE LABEL AND FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS.
Check the sanitizing solution concentration daily with chlorine test strips.
Make a new bleach water solution as needed, depending on the quality and concentration of chlorine. Protect yourself by wearing appropriate gloves and using the solution carefully.
Do not mix bleach with other chemicals due to the potential for hazardous fumes.
Always ADD BLEACH TO COOL WATER!

Appropriate Sanitizer and Disinfectant, Page 102 in this manual has instructions for ratios of bleach to water. This reference is from the resource Caring for Our Children. This is most likely for bleach that has an Active Ingredient of Sodium Hypochlorite at 5.25%- 6%, not the 8.25%. So the tables for the Appropriate Sanitizer and Disinfectant in the appendix that starts on page 102 do not apply for bleach with 8.25% Sodium Hypochlorite. Read the label on the bleach container.

Hand Washing Steps
 Hand washing is a disease prevention practice which must be done correctly and at appropriate times to be effective.
• Young children must be reminded to wash their hands at appropriate times;
• Young children must be monitored for correct hand washing steps to ensure effectiveness;
• All diapered children, regardless of age, must have their hands washed after diapering.
• Use all steps; moistened towelettes are NOT recommended for routine hand washing practice. However, they may be used in the absence of soap and water, such as a field trip or for quick removal of dirt and sticky substances.
Supplies Include:
Warm running water, with mixing type faucets; sinks that drain quickly and completely.
Appropriate Hand Washing Times Include:
Adults:
 • When you arrive at the program/school;
• Before and after first aid or temperature taking;
• Before and after preparing foods, snacks, or bottles;
• Before and after giving medications;
31

• After using the toilet or helping a child to use the toilet;
• After diapering a child;
• After you handle items soiled with waste or body fluids such as urine; saliva; stool; and blood or discharge from the eyes, nose, or sores;
• After prolonged sneezing or coughing;
• After caring for a pet, animal or sick child;
• After messy activities;
Children:
• When they arrive at the program/school;
• Before eating meals and snack;
• After their diaper is changed;
• After they use the toilet;
• After playing with animals and pets;
• After outdoor play;
• After prolonged coughing, sneezing, or wiping nose;
• After messy activities.
How Diseases Are Spread
This section tells about disease that can spread from one person to another. Children in the home or in any type of child care setting can get these diseases, but they have MORE chances to pick up disease germs when they spend a long part of each day in a group setting. Knowing about these diseases and how they spread will help you take measure to stop them in your child care setting.
There are three basic kinds of diseases that occur in child care:
• Diseases that spread through the intestinal tract
• Diseases that spread through the respiratory system
• Diseases that spread through direct contact (touching)
Diseases That Spread Through the Intestinal Tract
Several diseases that travel easily among young children pass from the intestinal tract of one person to another. When a few of these disease germs enter a person’s MOUTH, they pass through the stomach into the INTESTINES and multiply there. Some of these diseases, like certain kinds of diarrhea, affect the intestinal tract only.
Diseases that spread through the intestinal tract appear in the stool (bowel movement, feces) of anyone who has the infection, WHETHER OR NOT THAT PERSON SEEMS OR FEELS SICK. This is why hand washing after using the toilet or changing diapers is ALWAYS important, not just when there is a known case of illness in your center.
Disease germs can live outside the body on objects or surfaces for hours or even days. Since you can’t see germs without a microscope, an object can LOOK clean even when there are disease-causing germs on it. Just a few germs are enough to spread an infection to another person or contaminate something that might end up in a child’s mouth.
Children who are not yet toilet trained probably pass intestinal tract infections most easily, but ANYONE who doesn’t carefully follow correct hygiene procedures can spread illness.
 32

Diseases That Spread Through the Respiratory System
Another group of diseases that occur most frequently in child care groups spread from the respiratory system of one person to another. Respiratory disease spread through the air when a person coughs or sneezes or even speaks or sings. In groups of children, respiratory infection may also spread by contact with saliva or the runny nose of an infected person. This can happen when a hand or an object touches the mouth, nose or eye of another child or adult. Or, it can happen through kissing, sharing food, cups and eating utensils. Respiratory disease germs can live on cloth, tissues, or other surfaces for hours or even days. Therefore, touching contaminated toys, tissues, and objects can spread these diseases.
People often spread respiratory disease during the incubation period before they come down with symptoms. Sometimes a child or an adult can spread one of these diseases even if they never develop symptoms of illness themselves.
Diseases That Spread by Direct Contact (Touching)
Other diseases that can be problems in child care are spread by direct contact. In other words, someone can catch these diseases imply by touching the infected area of another person’s body. The most common diseases in this group are: HEAD LICE, IMPETIGO, SCABIES and CHICKEN POX.
Infection Control Measures
TREAT ALL BODY FLUIDS AND BLOOD AS IF THEY WERE INFECTIOUS!
Hand washing
• Supplies include warm running water; liquid soap; and disposable, single use paper towels or commercial hand blowers.
• Wash the fronts, backs, and in between the fingers with soap and gentle pressure (friction).
• Dry hands completely with a single use paper towel or commercial hand blowers.
• Hand washing guidelines apply to infants, children, and adults who have experienced potential exposure.
Wash hands BEFORE:
• Preparing food, snacks, or bottles.
• Serving food, snacks, or bottles.
• Eating food, snacks.
• Giving medication or taking temperatures.
• Cleaning wounds or changing bandages.
• Doing any medical or invasive procedure.
• Beginning activities that involve food.
Wash hands AFTER:
• ANY contact with stool, urine, vomitus, mucus, pus, blood, or body fluid.
• Playing with pets, animals, or birds.
• Changing a diaper.
• Changing a bandage.
• Tending to a sick child (person) for any reason.
• Using the toilet.
33

• Messy activities.
• Playing outside, sandboxes, on equipment, etc. Remember:
• Bathrooms and hand washing areas must be regularly supplied.
• Diapered age children must have their hands washed for them, especially after diapering.
• Young children must be monitored and reminded of hand washing steps each day.
• Moistened towelettes are not recommended for routine hand washing. They may be used in the absence of running water and soap, like field trips and for a quick clean-up for soil, grime, or sticky substances.
Disease Risks Increase With Dirty Or Contaminated Hands. Stop The Spread!
Gloves
Wear Gloves for High-Risk Procedures Such as:
• Cleaning up vomitus, stool, blood, urine, pus, and body fluids or secretions.
• Changing bandages, especially if blood, pus, or signs of infection are present.
• Cleansing or controlling wounds that bleed or have broken the skin, such as nosebleeds, tooth loss, cuts.
• Changing diapers.
• Handling linens, clothing, diapers, equipment or surfaces that have been soiled with blood, vomitus,
stool, urine, or body fluids. Gloving Guidelines Include:
• High-Risk Procedures are used when you anticipate the presence of potentially infectious materials, items, fluids, or tasks. Contact includes pus, mucus, vomitus, open wounds, stool, vaginal fluids, semen, or blood.
• Gather all supplies and equipment before putting gloves on.
• Discard visibly contaminated and potentially contaminated gloves, paper towels, bandages, cotton balls, tissues, etc., used during high risk procedures into a separate, closed plastic bag before disposal into the plastic-lined trash receptacle.
• Remove gloves immediately after completing high-risk procedures, by peeling them off of the hands, thus turning the gloves inside out; discarding the gloves into the bag of contaminated items or into the plastic-lined, soiled diaper receptacle.
• After removing gloves, proceed with the task of re-diapering, re-bandaging, replacing supplies, etc.
• Wash your hands before moving to another activity.
• Gloves used for high-risk procedures must be discarded immediately. They must be single use, disposable gloves. NEVER reuse these gloves.
• CAUTION: Not all gloves are made for re-use. They must be purchased as gloves for cleaning, and are generally a heavier, sturdier glove made of a rubber-type material.
• Latex or other type of disposable gloves are to be used by individuals performing high-risk procedures. Gloves only protect the person wearing them, so care must be taken to prevent contaminated gloves from infecting others or the environment.
34

Sanitation/Disinfecting
• Sanitation/disinfecting practices include cleaning the item or surface with soap and water to remove soil, grime, debris, and oils prior to the sanitizing activity.
• Sanitizing or disinfecting practices kills germs (pathogens) by: using commercially prepared germicidal agents (not just antibacterial); using physical agents such as very high temperatures or heat; and using household bleach and water solutions.
• The activity of sanitizing will kill germs, on contact, when properly used. The activity of cleaning reduces the germs to a “safer level” by the use of soaps, detergents, cleaners, and water.
• Sponges are never recommended for cleaning and sanitizing activities because they harbor germs and spread them to surfaces.
• Dishwashers clean items, and can assist in the sanitizing process if the water temperature is hot enough, the water pressure is adequate, and the cycle length is appropriate.
• An EPA approved germicidal solution may be used for sanitizing activities, however, care must be taken to prevent toxic substances from accumulating or remaining on items that directly or indirectly go into the mouth.
• Fabrics contaminated with blood, stool, vomit, pus, mucus, or other body fluid must be handled carefully, and laundered separately from general laundry or commercial laundry services.
• Automatic clothes dryers on hot settings and direct sunlight assist in the germ killing process. Laundry Bleach Solutions
• 1 tablespoon household bleach, mixed with 1 gallon hot water, in the wash cycle.
• Minimum 5-minute wash cycle, hot dryer. Soak Bleach Solution
• 1 tablespoon household bleach, mixed with 1 gallon water, room temperature mixed in a sink, bucket, or container for rinsing 2-5 minute soak. Remove from the bleach rinse and AIR DRY.
General Bleach Spray Solution
• 1 tbsp. household bleach, mixed with 1 gallon water in a well labeled spray bottle for sanitizing. Allow a minimum of 2 minutes (recommendation) contact time before wiping dry with a disposable paper towel.
Bloodborne Exposure
• 1 part household bleach, mixed with 10 parts water in a well-labeled spray bottle. Allow a two-minute contact time contact time before wiping dry with a disposable paper towel or air dry.
Diapering Area
• 1-3 tbsps. household bleach to one quart of water in a well-labeled spray bottle. Allow a two-minute contact time before wiping dry with a disposable paper towel or air dry.
Bagging
• Disposal of items which are visibly contaminated or potentially infectious must be separated from the general trash by proper disposal into a separate, closed (tied off or taped) plastic bag.
• Before bagging, bulk stool or vomitus may be discarded into the toilet and flushed. Caution: Limit rinsing, shaking, wringing or dunking to prevent contamination of your clothing, skin, toilet and air.
35

Types of Bagging:
• Disposal diaper, diaper wipes and gloves, etc. must be placed into a plastic lined container before disposal into the general trash (diaper pail).
• All clothing which has been soiled with urine, vomitus, stool, blood or other bloody fluid must be placed into a separate plastic bag, labeled with name and sent home for laundering. Note: Children should have a change of clothes available to them. If the program provides laundry service, all staff must know how to handle contaminated laundry.
• All contaminated syringe needles, glass, blades or vials must be discarded into an appropriate “sharp’s container.” NEVER re-cap needles. Sharps containers must be discarded according to state and local OSHA guidelines.
• All paper towels, bandages, cotton, gauze, gloves, etc., used for any type of bleeding injury must be discarded into a separate sealed, plastic bag before discarding into a plastic lined trash receptacle.
• All sanitary napkins and feminine hygiene products must be placed into a plastic lined trash receptacle and sealed or tied off before discarding in the general trash.
CAUTION:
• All gloves used during high risk procedures, must be properly discarded immediately after use.
• Store the contaminated, labeled, laundry bags in a separate plastic lined receptacle until laundry is picked up by parents, laundry service or laundered at the program site. Do not place in cubbies or diaper bags, as these areas often contain clean items, food and/or bottles. Contamination is very likely. Although these guidelines are accepted infection control measures, they are not intended to replace or substitute the mandated OSHA standards which may apply to the school or child care program. If the program is responding to the Federal Standards, and are developing an OSHA Exposure Control Plan, strict criteria must be met.
Symptoms of Illness
A child should be checked as they enter the child care facility and observed for illness throughout the day.
• Severe coughing – child gets red or blue in the face (makes high-pitched croupy or whooping sounds after he coughs)
• Breathing trouble – especially important in an infant under six months old
• Yellowish skin or eyes
• Pinkeye (tears, redness of eyelid lining, irritation, followed by swelling and discharge of pus)
• Unusual spots or rashes
• Infected skin patch(s) – crusty bright yellow, dry, or gummy areas of skin
• Feverish
• Unusual behavior – cranky, less active than usual, cries more, looks unwell
• Frequent scratching of scalp or skin
• Gray or white bowel movement
• Unusually dark, tea-colored urine
• Sore throat or trouble swallowing

36

• Loss of appetite • Diarrhea
When a Child Has Symptoms
• Inform the doctor
• Isolate the child
• Check temperature if feverish
• Remind child to cover mouth when sneezing or coughing and to wash their hands
• If you wipe a nose, throw the tissue away and wash your hands
• Wash your hands if you touch a child who might be ill
• Occasionally ask each child’s parent(s) whether everyone in the family is well. If a child’s family member is sick, watch for signs of illness in the child
• Diarrheal Diseases

treatment.
    “Heat Rash” (Prickly Heat)
  Often appears in moist skin folds of legs, arms, and neck; also common at waistline and on buttocks.
  Bands of reddened areas or patches of reddened skin surfaces.
   • Heat rash is a result of hot, humid conditions and direct skin contact with itself, wet diapers, or clothing.
• Most often associated with plastic diaper pants or disposable diaper plastic irritating the skin surface and increasing the sweat gland stimulus.
    Diaper Rash
    Reddened skin on buttock, or “diaper area” as a result of irritation from stool, urine, infection, or prolonged contact with plastic diapering materials. Occurs in moist, warm conditions.
   Rash can be generalized reddened skin surfaces, evolving to blistered appearance with skin breakdown. Can become inflamed, moist, and bleeding patches.
     • This rash causes discomfort and pain.
• Diaper rash can be caused by prolonged contact with soiled diapers.
• This rash may be caused by fungal or viral infections (germs which are contagious).
    Drug or food reaction rashes
     Ranges from fever; red, runny eyes; hives; sores in the mouth; genital lesions; asthma- like symptoms to extreme difficulty breathing.
   Rash may appear as raised skin surfaces like “welts” or hives in a cluster. Itching usually present. Rash may appear rapidly, and can range from an isolated skin area to a full body rash.
     • Assess the use of new medications, food, or skin surface lotions, etc. to prevent further illness by immediately eliminating them.
• Thisrashcanbeasignofa serious, quickly-occurring condition, especially if it appears for no apparent reason or if no other signs or illness are present.
   • If a rash occurs suddenly with fainting, swelling, vomiting, and/or difficulty breathing, CALL 911.
• Do not ignore rashes; they are not a normal state of health, and can be a symptom of contagious illness.
• In group settings, post a “Parent Alert” notice if a rash is diagnosed or identified as a contagious illness.
• Call the local health department for information regarding rash symptoms.
• Even non-contagious rash conditions can be a symptom of a health threat... even if it is just unsightly, uncomfortable, or itchy! Medical attention may be needed to reduce symptoms or disease risks.

Norovirus
Pertussis (Whooping Cough) Polio
Rubella
Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) Salmonellosis
Shigella
Tuberculosis
It is essential to notify the health department immediately when a child in a child care setting has a serious infectious disease. The goal of the health department is to help the child care provider prevent the further spread of infectious disease.
The information sheets in this manual can be used to notify parents about infectious disease and answer most of their questions. Letters are provided to be given to the parents for most of the diseases. However, if any children in your facility have one of the above diseases please contact your local health Department epidemiologists as soon as possible.
43

When to notify Parents if the illness is in the school/daycare
The following is a list of illness that parents should be informed of but are not reportable to the health department. Chicken Pox
Conjunctivitis (Pinkeye) Fifth Disease
Hand Foot and Mouth Impetigo
Ringworm
Scabies
Staphylococcal infections Strep or Scarlet Fever
The information sheets in the manual can be used to notify parents about the above diseases and answer most of their questions. If you have any questions, please contact your local health department.
Amebiasis
Signs and Symptoms:
On average, about one in ten people who are infected with E. histolytica become sick from the infection. The symptoms are often quite mild and can include loose stools, stomach pain, and stomach cramping. Amebic dysentery is a severe form of Amebiasis associated with stomach pain, bloody stools and fever. Rarely E. histolytica invades the liver and forms an abscess. Even less commonly, it spreads to other parts of the body such as the lungs or brain.
Immediate Intervention:
All children with diarrhea should be excluded. If the child is found to be positive for Amebiasis, they may return if effective therapeutic treatment regimen is completed and / or at least two approved fecal specimens collected 24 hours apart are negative.
Incubation Period:
Usually 2-4 weeks, though it can take longer for symptoms to occur.
Contagious Period:
A person is no longer contagious 24-48 hours after beginning medical treatment.
Transmission:
Mainly spread through the ingestion of food or water that has been contaminated with amoebic cysts:
• By putting anything into your mouth that has touched the stool of a person who is infected with Amebiasis
• By touching and bringing to your mouth cysts (eggs) picked up from surfaces that are contaminated with Amebiasis.
44

School/Child Care Attendance: Restrictions:
All individuals with diarrhea should be excluded. If laboratory studies confirm the presence of Amebiasis, the individual should be excluded from the group setting until an effective therapeutic regimen is completed and /or at least two approved fecal specimens collected 24 hours apart are negative for Amebiasis.
Contacts:
Contacts may not perform food handling duties, or care for children in child care center, if signs and symptoms of Amebiasis are present. Have at least one (1) stool test result that is negative for this organism.
Screening of other contacts that do not have signs and symptoms is not recommended.
Reports Required:
All cases must be reported to your local Health Department within three (3) working days of identification. Campylobacteriosis
Signs and Symptoms:
Diarrhea, abdominal pain, fever, nausea, and vomiting. Often the stool (feces, bowel movement) will be bloody.
Immediate Intervention:
Child should stay home. Exclude child until two approved fecal specimens are tested for this bacteria and are negative.
Incubation Period:
From 1-10 days, usually 3 to 5 days after infection.
Contagious Period:
During the time the person is ill. Treatment with antibiotics can shorten the time the infected person may spread
the disease to 2 or 3 days.
Transmission:
Contaminated water, raw milk, food, and infected animals and people transmit this illness. The germs are in the stool of anyone who is infected. The germs may get on the infected person’s hands when they use the toilet or germs may go to the hands of a caregiver changing an infected child’s diaper. From the contaminated hands, the germs may be spread to another person, or they may contaminate something which might end up in the child’s mouth (toys or food). Illness typically lasts one week.
School/Child Care Attendance: Restrictions:
All individuals with diarrhea should be excluded. If laboratory studies confirm the presence of Campylobacteriosis, the individual should be excluded from the group setting until 2 approved fecal specimens have been collected at least 24 hours apart and are both negative for Campylobacteriosis.
Contacts:
Contacts may not perform food handling duties, or care for children in child care centers, if signs and symptoms of Campylobacteriosis are present. Avoid milk that is not pasteurized and water that is not chlorinated.
Screening of other contacts that do not have signs and symptoms is not recommended. 45

Reports Required:
Report to the health department within (3) working days of identification.
For food handlers: Immediate telephone reports of cases or suspect cases to the local health department are required.
Special Features:
Infected individuals with mild symptoms or without signs or symptoms can spread this disease by poor hygiene habits. This illness is often spread from child to child in diapered groups. Stress careful hand washing after toileting, after changing diapers and before food preparation and eating. Illness typically lasts one week.
Chickenpox (Varicella)
Signs and Symptoms:
Slight fever, listlessness, a rash that can be seen and felt, and then the rash appears as small fluid-filled blisters (vesicles) for 3-4 days. The blisters break and then scab over. Several stages of blisters may be present at the same time.
Immediate Intervention:
Isolate the individual.
Incubation Period:
Commonly 14-16 days; some cases occur as early as 11 days and as late as 20 days after contact.
Contagious Period:
Two days before blisters appear until all blisters have dry, complete scabs.
Transmission:
Spread by direct contact with the fluid in the blister or items contaminated with the fluid. Dry scabs are not infective. Also spread by contact with the secretions from the nose and mouth of an infected individual. These secretions may be on environmental surfaces or in infected droplets in the air.
School/Child Care Attendance: Restrictions:
Exclude until all blisters are scabbed over and dry (average 4 – 7 days after rash onset), and the individual is fever- free for 24 hours. A child exempted from day care immunization requirements may be excluded from day care in the event of a disease outbreak.
Contacts:
A person who is diagnosed as having varicella must not work in any occupation in which there is direct contact with children in a day care facility as long as the disease is in communicable form.
Reports Required:
No reports required.
Special Features:
Chickenpox, also called varicella, is a highly contagious but not usually serious disease caused by a herpes virus.
Individuals with chickenpox should not take aspirin. Non-aspirin products may be used for fever-reduction. The use of aspirin has been associated with Reye’s Syndrome.
46

Use of creams or lotions containing diphenhydramine (Benadryl) is not recommended, unless prescribed by a health care provider.
Varicella-zoster immune globulin (VZIG) may be recommended in immunocompromised children, and adults with no history of chickenpox who are exposed to the disease. VZIG may also be recommended for a newborn infant of any woman who develops chickenpox within 5 days before delivery to 48 hours after delivery. If pregnant and exposed to chickenpox, the pregnant woman should inform her health care provider.
Shingles (herpes zoster) is a recurrence of a previous infection with chickenpox. Do not exclude individuals with shingles if blisters can be covered completely with clothing, or a bandage. Keep covered until blisters are scabbed over and dry.
Recommended immunization schedules may include varicella vaccine given on or after the first birthday. A second dose may be needed for older children and adults. Varicella vaccine has been used in the past for certain high-risk individuals, and in studies to determine its effectiveness.
47

Informational Letter for Parents Chickenpox
Dear Parents:
A child in our school/daycare center has chickenpox. Chickenpox, one of the most common infections of childhood, is highly contagious, but rarely a serious health threat to otherwise healthy people.
What are the symptoms?
Symptoms of fever and skin rash begin 14 to 21 days after exposure to a contagious person. The skin rash begins as red bumps on the chest, back, underarms, neck, and face. These change into blisters and finally form scabs.
Who is contagious?
Persons are contagious from a day or two prior to developing the rash until the last crop of blisters has dried into scabs. Children may return to daycare or school when all the blisters have scabbed over. Exposed children without symptoms do not need to stay home unless chickenpox develops.
If your child is taking steroid medication like Cortisone or Prednisone, or has ever been treated for cancer, you should immediately seek advice from your physician to see if your child may need special preventative treatment.
If your child develops chickenpox, you may wish to discuss the illness with your child’s physician. If you have any questions, please call your local health department office or medical provider.
48

Conjunctivitis (Pink Eye)
Signs and Symptoms:
Watering, irritation, and redness of the white part of the eye and/or the lining of the eyelids. Swelling of the eyelids, sensitivity to light, and a pus-like discharge may occur.
Immediate Intervention:
Refer to a health care provider for treatment.
Incubation Period:
From 12 - 72 hours-Bacterial From 24 - 72 hours-Viral
Contagious Period:
From the onset of signs and symptoms, and while the eye is still red and draining.
Transmission:
Direct contact with the discharge from the eyes, nose, oral secretions or items soiled with discharge.
School/Child Care Attendance: Restrictions:
Exclude children or staff:
1. If they are unable to participate in activities.
2. Care for other children would be compromised because of the care that the child with conjunctivitis requires.
3. The person with conjunctivitis has a fever or a change in behavior
4. Health care professional or the health department recommends exclusion
Contacts:
No restrictions. Children and staff in close contact with a person with Conjunctivitis should be observed for symptoms and referred for evaluation, if indicated.
Reports Required:
No reports are required. If there is an unusual increase in the number of individuals affected with conjunctivitis (above 10% in a single group setting), notify the local health department for additional management steps.
Special Features:
Individuals should be counseled not to share towels, wash cloths, or eye make-up.
Careful hand washing after contact with discharge from the eyes or articles soiled with the discharge is necessary. Throw away all tissues immediately after one use. Use face cloths one time and on only one individual before laundering.
Viral conjunctivitis, unlike bacterial conjunctivitis, will not respond to antibiotic treatment and the signs and symptoms and contagious period will be prolonged.
49

Informational Letter for Parents Conjunctivitis (Pink Eye)
Dear Parent:
A child in our school/daycare center has developed conjunctivitis (pink eye).
What is conjunctivitis?
Conjunctivitis means the “whites of the eyes” have become red due to irritation or an infection.
What causes conjunctivitis?
Bacteria, viruses, chemical reactions, allergies, or direct contact with discharge from the eyes of infected persons. Discharge from the eye(s) on fingers, towels, washcloths, and handkerchiefs may spread the infection.
Is conjunctivitis contagious?
Yes, if certain viral or bacterial organisms cause it.
What are some of the symptoms of infectious conjunctivitis?
1. Itching, irritation, and a scratchy feeling in one or both eyes.
2. A discharge, which may cause the eyelids to stick together in the morning.
How can conjunctivitis be prevented?
Practice frequent and thorough hand washing at all times after wiping noses or faces. DO NOT use a common washcloth, drying towel, or blankets for the children. A primary care provider should evaluate children with severe and prolonged symptoms. Careful hand hygiene and sanitizing of surfaces and objects are the best way to prevent spread.
What should I do if I think my child has conjunctivitis?
See your physician for diagnosis and treatment.
If you have any questions, please call your local health department office or medical provider.

Cryptosporidiosis (Cryptosporidium parvum)
Signs and Symptoms:
Diarrhea (loose, watery stools), cramps, upset stomach, and sometimes fever. Some people will not develop symptoms at all.
Immediate Intervention:
Child should stay home until he/she has submitted 2 approved fecal specimens collected at least 24 hours apart that have been negative for Cryptosporidiosis and diarrhea has ceased for 24 hours. In December 2002 the FDA approved a drug treatment, nitazoxinide for patients 1-11 years of age only. Persons with diarrhea should drink plenty of fluids to keep hydrated. Infants, the elderly, persons with compromised immune systems, or other chronic illnesses are at greater risk of serious illness as a result of cryptosporidiosis. No swimming or entering pools for 2 weeks after symptoms stop.
Incubation Period:
Generally from 7-10 days, but can be as many as twenty-one days.
Contagious Period:
During the time the person has diarrhea. Infected persons can pass the parasites in their stool for up to two months after becoming ill.
Transmission:
Swallowing water containing the oocysts (oh-oh-cysts) which are the infectious stage of the parasites. The oocysts can be found in contaminated lakes, rivers, springs, ponds, streams, irrigation water, hot tubs, Jacuzzis, and swimming pools. Eating uncooked food, especially unwashed vegetables or fruit contaminated by cryptosporidium. Oral/anal sexual contact with an infected person. Contact with contaminated surfaces such as children’s toys, bathroom fixtures, diaper changing tables, diaper pails, etc. Not washing hands after handling soiled diapers or after playing with infected animals, especially calves, puppies and kittens.

52

Informational Letter for Parents Cytomegalovirus Infections (CMV)
Dear Parent:
A child at our school/daycare center has Cytomegalovirus Infection (CMV). For most healthy children and adults who get CMV after birth there are few symptoms and no long-term health consequences.
It is important to contact your medical care provider if you are pregnant and have had a potential exposure to CMV since it can cause stillbirth and birth defects in rare cases.
What causes Cytomegalovirus?
The infection is acquired by direct contact with mouth or nose secretions, breast milk, stool or urine from a person who is infected with Cytomegalovirus.
What are the signs and symptoms?
CMV usually has no apparent symptoms initially. Once a child has the infection it will live in the body and may cause fever, sore throat, listlessness and swollen lymph nodes. Occasionally there will be swelling of the spleen or abdomen and a skin rash. Occasionally jaundice will occur.
How can Cytomegalovirus be prevented?
The best way to prevent CMV is to make sure your child is washing their hands. If there are further questions or concerns contact your health care provider.
53

E. coli O157:H7/Shiga Toxin producing E.Coli
Signs and Symptoms:
Infected people show a range of symptoms, including mild diarrhea, or no symptoms at all. Most identified cases develop severe diarrhea and abdominal cramps. Blood is often seen in the stool. Usually, little or no fever is present.
Immediate Intervention:
Child should be excluded from school until seen by a provider and diarrhea has stopped.
Incubation Period:
2-8 days, usually 3-4 days
Contagious Period:
Less than 1 week in adults. Up to 3 weeks in children. Prolonged infections are uncommon; however, bacteria can be shed for several weeks after symptoms cease in some cases.
Transmission:
Occurs by the ingestion of undercooked beef, unpasteurized milk, and fruit and vegetable products fertilized or irrigated with contaminated water. Person to person spread is common within families and day care centers. Waterborne transmission has been documented from lakes, shallow wells, and under- chlorinated swimming pools.
School/Child Care Attendance: Restrictions:
All individuals with diarrhea must be excluded. If laboratory testing confirms the presence of E. coli 0157:H7, or other Shiga Toxin E. coli (STEC), the child or care giver may not attend. The individual will be excluded until 2 approved fecal specimens are negative for E. coli 0157:H7 or other STEC.
Contacts:
Contacts may not perform food handling duties, or care for children in child care centers if signs and symptoms are present.
Screening of other contacts, which do not have signs or symptoms, is not recommended.
Reports Required:
Reporting to the health department is required within one working day of identification.
For food handlers: Immediate telephone reports of cases or suspect cases to the local health department are required.
Special Features:
Infected individuals with mild symptoms or without signs or symptoms can spread this disease by poor hygiene habits. This illness is often spread from child to child in diapered groups. Stress careful hand washing after toileting, after changing diapers and before food preparation and eating.
Fifth Disease
Signs and Symptoms:
May be mild illness: Low fever, headache, body ache, nausea, or chills for 2-3 days. About a week later a rash appears beginning with bright-redness of the cheeks (slapped check appearance). The cheeks are hot but not painful. There may also be scattered red raised spots on the chin, forehead, and behind the ears. Approximately 1 day later a lace-like rash spreads to upper arms and legs, and sometimes the trunk. This lacy rash may disappear
54

and then reappear over a period of weeks, particularly after exposure to sunlight, or extreme heat or cold. Adults may not develop the rash but may experience aching in the joints, particularly at the wrist and knees.
Immediate Intervention:
Exclude all individuals who have fever.
Incubation Period:
From 4-14 days.
Contagious Period:
Before the appearance of the rash during the mild symptoms.
Transmission:
Contact with secretions from the nose, mouth, and throat of an infected person. The secretions may be on surfaces or in infected droplets in the air.
School/Child Care Attendance: Restrictions:
Exclude all individuals until fever-free and those with a blood disorder, such as sickle cell disease, or a compromised immune system (may shed large amounts of virus and may appear ill). Fever-free individuals diagnosed with Fifth disease may return to the group setting although a rash may still be present.
Contacts:
No restrictions.
Reports Required:
None. If there is an unusual absentee rate (above 10% of individuals in a single group setting) with Fifth Disease, notify the local health department for additional management steps.
Special Features:
Most cases occur in the late winter and early spring. Fifth Disease is caused by human Parvo virus B19 which lives in the nose and throat. Outbreaks of this illness among children in child care and elementary school are not unusual.
Many people have already had Fifth Disease before reaching young adulthood. It is estimated that half the adults in the United States are immune because of previous infection.
There is no treatment for Fifth Disease.
55

Informational Letter for Parents Fifth Disease
Dear Parent:
A child in our school/daycare has been diagnosed with Fifth disease. Fifth disease, also called “slapped cheek disease,” is an infection caused by parvovirus B19. Outbreaks most often occur in winter and spring, but a person may become ill with fifth disease any time of the year. Most persons who get fifth disease are not very ill and recover without any serious consequences. However, children with Sickle Cell Anemia, chronic anemia, or an impaired immune system may become seriously ill when infected with parvovirus B19 and may require medical care.
What are the symptoms?
Symptoms begin with a mild fever and complaints of tiredness. After a few days, the cheeks take on a flushed appearance that looks like the face has been slapped. There may also be a lacy rash on the trunk, arm, and legs. Not all infected individuals develop a rash.
Who is contagious?
Once the rash appears, the child is no longer contagious. Therefore, a child who has been diagnosed with fifth disease need not be excluded from school/childcare. However, a child does need to be kept at home until the fever is gone.
Pregnant women and parents of children who have an impaired immune system, sickle cell anemia, or other blood disorders may want to consult their physician.
If you have any questions, please call your local health department office or medical provider.
56

Giardiasis
Signs and Symptoms:
Often occurs without symptoms. A variety of diarrhea symptoms may be present including frequent loose, watery (or unformed) stools. Stools may be foul-smelling and accompanied by cramping and gas.
Immediate Intervention:
If symptomatic, exclude and refer to a health care provider for specific stool examination and treatment.
Incubation Period:
From 3-25 days; average 7-10 days.
Contagious Period:
As long as the protozoan is present in the stool.
Transmission:
Stool-to-mouth (fecal-oral) by way of unwashed hands, or food contaminated by unwashed hands. Often transmitted in the child care setting among diapered children. Drinking untreated water from lakes or streams.
School/Child Care Attendance:
Restrictions:
All individuals with diarrhea should be excluded. If laboratory studies confirm the presence of giardia, the individual should be excluded from the group setting until 48 hours after appropriate treatment has been initiated and the individual has no diarrhea, cramping, or fever. Children and adults wish giardiasis should not swim in public pools or water parks for two weeks after symptoms resolve.
Contacts:
Contacts may not perform food handling duties, or care for children in child care centers, if signs and symptoms of giardiasis are present.
Screening of other contacts, which do not have signs or symptoms, is not recommended.
Reports Required:
Reporting to the health department is required within three (3) working days of identification.
For food handlers: Immediate telephone reports of cases or suspect cases to the local health department are required.
Special Features:
Infected individuals without signs or symptoms can spread this parasite by poor hygiene habits. This illness is often spread from child to child in diapered groups. Stress careful hand-washing after toileting, after changing diapers, before food preparation, and before eating.
Hand, Foot, & Mouth Disease (Coxsackie Virus Infection)
Signs and Symptoms:
Fever, and a sore throat accompanied by small sores in the mouth. Small blister-like rash may be present on the hands and feet. Occasionally a rash may be present on the buttocks.
57

Immediate Intervention:
Isolate and exclude while fever and mouth sores are still present.
Incubation Period:
3 – 5 days.
Contagious Period:
Most contagious during the time when the fever and sore throat are present, but the virus may be present in the stool for several weeks.
Transmission:
Contact with secretions from the nose, mouth, and throat. Also, stool-to-mouth (fecal-oral) spread by way of unwashed hands, or foods contaminated by unwashed hands.
School/Child Care Attendance:
Because of the increased opportunities for spread in the child care setting, management will differ from the school setting.
Restrictions:
Some children may shed the virus without becoming ill, and other children who became ill may shed the virus for weeks in the stool.
Child Care:
Exclude until fever-free and mouth sores are no longer present.
School:
Exclude until fever-free.
Contacts:
No restrictions.
Reports Required:
No reports are required.
Special Features:
Hand, Foot, & Mouth Disease is seen most often in the summer and early fall.
Care in hand washing, as well as handling diapers and all items contaminated with stool and secretions of the nose, mouth, and throat, is essential.

Informational Letter for Parents
Hand, Foot and Mouth Disease
Dear Parent:
A child in our school/daycare has been diagnosed with Hand, Food and Mouth Disease. What is Hand Foot and Mouth Disease?
Hand, foot, and mouth disease is a common illness of infants and children and is usually a mild disease. Nearly everyone will recover without medical treatment in 7 to 10 days. It is often confused with foot-and-mouth disease of cattle, sheep and swine. Although the names are similar, the two diseases are not related at all and are caused by different viruses.
What causes Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease?
Hand, foot, and mouth disease is caused by the coxsackie virus and occurs mainly in children under 10 years old. What are the signs and symptoms?
Generally a child will have a mild fever, poor appetite and sore throat. One or 2 days after the fever begins, painful sores develop in the mouth. They begin as small red spots that blister and then often become ulcers that can be found on tongue, gums and inside of the cheeks. A small blister-like rash may be present on the hands and feet and occasionally the buttocks.
How can Hand, Foot and Mouth Disease be prevented?
Children are most contagious during the time when the fever and sore throat are present. For that reason, all children must be excluded from daycare until fever-free and mouth sores are no longer present.

Head Lice (Pediculosis)
Signs and Symptoms:
Itching of the scalp. Lice and nits (eggs) found in hair, especially at the nape of the neck and behind the ears.
Immediate Intervention:
Children should not be excluded immediately or sent home early from child care or early education facility due to the presence of head lice. However, procedures which include treatment, screening of contacts, and environmental management must be carried out immediately and at the same time as treatment.
Incubation Period:
From 6-14 days.
Contagious Period:
As long as live lice are present on the head or in the environment.
Transmission:
Direct head-to-head contact between individuals, or indirect spread through shared items such as combs, brushes, head phones, towels, hats, coats, and sleeping mats or cots. Upholstered furniture, car upholstery, rugs, carpets, and items like stuffed animals can harbor head lice. Head lice can survive off the body for 1-2 days, allowing for re- infestation. Household pets are not a source of head lice.
Child Care Attendance:
Restrictions:
Children should not be excluded. Inform parents immediately. The best practice is an immediate treatment prior to returning to child care facility. According to the National Resource Center for Health and Safety in Child Care and Early Education (Caring for Our Children), the institution of “no-nit” policies before permitting return of an infested child to child care is not effective in controlling transmission.
Contacts:
All family members, close contacts, and classroom contacts should be checked and treated if infestation is found.
Reports Required:
No reports are required. If there is an unusual increase in the number of individuals infested (above 10% in a single group setting), notify the local health department for additional management steps.
Special Features:
Many effective over-the-counter products are available without a prescription. Home remedies are most often ineffective, and some are dangerous. Pregnant women and the parents of infants should contact a health care provider for treatment recommendations.
• Educate parents on treatment steps.
• Shaving the head is unnecessary!
• Only treat infested individuals.
• Follow specific treatment directions found with the product used on the hair.
• Improper or excessive use of products may cause toxic effects.
• Some lice are resistant to treatment. To assure effective treatment, all nits must be removed. 60
 
• Remove as many nits as possible with a fine-tooth comb or by picking nits from the hair with fingers or nit-removal tweezers. Discard the comb or tweezers immediately.
• Wash recently used clothing, bedding, towels, combs, and brushes with soap and hot water (at least 120° F) for 10 minutes.
• Place items that cannot be cleaned (stuffed animals for example) in a sealed plastic bag for 10-14 days.
• V acuum carpets, mattresses, upholstered furniture.
• Environmental pesticide sprays are not recommended for lice management in the home or group setting.
Head Lice Advice and the LiceMeisterTM Comb
The following information is for parents who have been unsuccessful eliminating head lice from their home. “Have you been shampooing hair, laundering, vacuuming, bagging everything, spraying pesticide in the house, using mayonnaise, tea tree oil and other home remedies?” Stop!
• Spend your energy nit picking. Since we are only dealing with head lice and not body lice, laundering every piece of clothing in the house is not necessary. DO launder bed linens and pajamas and wash clothes that the person is wearing the day of treatment.
• Lice normally cannot survive more than 24 hours off of our heads. They need warmth (our body heat) and food (our blood). Without us they die. They will not leave us unless they detect another person’s head and hair nearby. Lice are not well adapted to walking on surfaces except hair. Lice prefer to follow hair like a train will follow a track.
• Vacuum mattresses and sofas. A live nit attached to a hair that falls off the head can survive more than 24 hours. However, it will not hatch without adequate warmth (approximately 90 ̊F). The newly hatched louse also must have food and it may not find any on a sofa or carpet unless you happen to be there when it hatches.
• Nits. A newly laid nit looks dark gray. They are attached to hair close to the scalp. As the hair grows it moves the nit further from the scalp. Empty nits are white in appearance. Nits containing a developing louse or a dead one look light brown or tan-colored.
• Nit removal is the key to successful elimination of head lice. The best comb for louse and nit removal is the LiceMeisterTM comb. The comb has 1.5 inch-long stainless steel teeth with precision spacing. Health Department personnel and parents who have used the comb know it is the most effective and efficient mechanical device for removing nits.
• If you have already used a louse shampoo in the past week, shampoo the hair with regular shampoo and use the LiceMeisterTM to remove any nits and live lice. Section off the hair before starting and combing.
• Lice of all ages/sizes are removed by the LiceMeisterTM. Dip the comb in hot tap water (over 130 ̊F) after each pass through the hair. Boiling is not necessary. The hot water will kill the live lice and nits. Keep the same side of the comb facing the scalp so lice will not be put back onto the next hair section combed. After use wash with soap and water.
• The use of the LiceMeisterTM comb eliminates the needs to use other chemical treatment. Regular use of the LiceMeisterTM can remove lice and nits before a big problem arises.
• The LiceMeisterTM is available from the National Pediculosis Association, P.O. box 610189, Newton, MA 02161. The internet address is www.headlice.org

Informational Letter for Parents Head Lice
Dear Parent:
A child in our school/daycare center has head lice. Lice are small insects which spend their entire lives living on humans. Having lice is not a sign of poor hygiene habits. Properly treated cases are no longer infectious.
How is it spread?
Lice spread easily by direct contact with the infested person or by sharing scarves, bed sheets, blankets, pillows, combs, or brushes with a person who has lice. Lice do not jump or fly; they only crawl. Animals do not spread human lice.
How would I know if my child has lice?
Lice cause scalp itching. Look for the lice or their eggs on their hair where the hair comes out of the scalp. Lice are small (less than 1/8 inch-long), tan-colored insects, alive and moving. They prefer the back of the scalp, behind the ears and above the neck. The eggs (nits) are gray-white specks glued to the hair. Even if you cannot find the insects, lice must be there if the eggs are there, and treatment has not been performed.
How do you get rid of head lice?
1. Use a medication prescribed by your doctor or an over-the-counter, nonprescription product from the drug store. Follow the directions as listed on the product.
2. Clean personal items by any of the following methods:
• Washing in hot water and soap in a washing machine.
• Putting in hot dryer for 20 minutes.
• Dry cleaning.
• Storing in a sealed plastic bag for two weeks.
• Boiling combs, brushes, curlers, etc. for ten minutes or; soaking in 2% Lysol* and water for one hour.
• Freezing for 12 hours.
3. Thorough vacuuming of (carpeting) floors, furniture and cars is recommended. Insecticide sprays are not
recommended.
How do I get the nits off after successful treatment?
A fine-tooth comb may be adequate. After two treatments, the removal of nits should not have any effect in preventing more lice as the eggs have either hatched or they are dead.
REMEMBER: Head lice are not choosy about who they infest. ANYONE can get them. They typically cause no illness – only some inconvenience. The important thing is to treat promptly and thoroughly. Your cooperation is essential in preventing the spread of head lice.
If you have any questions, please call your local health department office or medical provider.

Hepatitis A
Signs and Symptoms:
In adults and older children: sudden onset with loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, listlessness, fever, abdominal pain. Often followed by jaundice, or dark-colored urine (cola-colored).
Young children with hepatitis A disease often have no symptoms, or symptoms listed above may be mild.
Immediate Intervention:
Refer to a health care provider for evaluation and diagnosis.
Incubation Period:
From 15-50 days; average 28-30 days.
Contagious Period:
From 1-3 weeks. Most contagious at least 1 week before the onset of illness. No longer contagious 1 week after the onset of jaundice.
Transmission:
From stool-to-mouth (fecal-oral) spread by way of unwashed hands or foods contaminated by unwashed hands. Hands can become contaminated during toileting and diapering activities.
School/Child Care Attendance:
Because of increased opportunities for spread in the child care setting, management will differ from the school setting. See Contacts.
Restrictions:
Individuals with diagnosed cases of Hepatitis A shall not attend group settings until the disease is no longer communicable as determined by a licensed physician (one week after onset or until immune serum globulin has been given). Children must have a note from the physician.
Exclude food handlers with hepatitis A from working in food serving during the first 2 weeks of illness.
Contacts:
Hepatitis A vaccine is now a recommended immunization (2 doses; initial dose and a second 6 – 18 months later) for all children 12 months and older.
Immune Globulin (called IG, ISG or GG) is often recommended for household contacts, and child care contacts. Rarely, immune globulin will be recommended for the public school setting. This decision is based on a case-by- case investigation by the local health department. To be effective, immune globulin must be given to contacts within 2 weeks of the last exposure to the infected individual. Immune globulin is safe for pregnant women.
Reports Required:
For food handlers: Immediate telephone reports of cases or suspect cases to the local health department are required.
For child care: Immediate telephone reports of cases or suspect cases in staff, children, or the household contacts of children are required.
For schools: Case reports are required.
63

Special Features:
Hepatitis A is a viral infection of the liver. This infection interferes with liver’s ability to digest food and keep the blood healthy. Most people will recover completely from this infection and maintain lifelong immunity to Hepatitis A Virus.
Careful hand washing, monitoring of diapering practices and management of soiled diapers are important prevention steps.
Because Hepatitis A Virus may survive on objects in the environment for weeks, careful cleaning and sanitizing of diaper changing areas, bathrooms, and food service areas is important.
Immunization schedules include Hepatitis A vaccine.
Hepatitis B
Signs and Symptoms:
Gradual onset of illness may include: loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, cola-colored urine, jaundice, diarrhea, itching of the skin, muscle and joint pain. Early symptoms vary with individuals.
Immediate Intervention:
Refer to a health care provider for evaluation, diagnosis and treatment.
Incubation Period:
From 45-180 days, average 60-90 days.
Contagious Period:
When Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) blood test is positive. This blood test may be positive for the rest of an individual’s life.
Transmission:
Casual contact with a Hepatitis B Virus (HBV)-infected person presents no risk of infection. HBV can be transmitted from person-to-person through:
Sexual intercourse (anal, vaginal, or rarely oral) with an infected individual;
Sharing HBV-contaminated intravenous needles and syringes used for street drugs, steroids, or tattoos;
Careless handling of items contaminated with infected blood or body fluids (bandages, tissues, paper towels, diapers, gloves, sanitary pads, hypodermic needles/syringes);
Saliva of an HBV-infected individual who bites another when the bite breaks the skin;
Rarely, transfusion of infected blood or blood products; and
From an infected mother to her baby in the womb, during birth, and possibly through breast feeding.
School/Child Care Attendance:
Restrictions:
Exclude until the individual’s signs and symptoms have disappeared and the person feels well enough to return.
Contacts:
No restrictions. For significant exposure, a health care provider may recommend immediate immunization with Hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG). Hepatitis B vaccine may also be indicated.
Report Required:
Report is required; contact the health department within one (1) working day of identification. 64

Herpes Simplex
Signs and Symptoms:
Fever Blisters (cold sores): Typically, clusters of tiny, fluid-filled blisters on a reddened base of skin around the lips, in the mouth, or on the face. These blisters crust and heal within a few days. Also called “cold sores.”
Genital Herpes: Clusters of very small (pencil-point size) fluid-filled blisters on a reddened base of skin in the genital area.
Immediate Intervention:
Isolate, exclude, and refer to the health care provider for diagnosis and appropriate treatment.
Incubation Period:
3-5 days
Contagious Period:
From the onset of the blisters until they are scabbed over and dry, generally from 2 to 24 days.
Transmission:
Fever Blisters: Direct contact with the virus in saliva, sores, or drool.
Genital Herpes: Through intimate sexual contact.
Herpes infections may be transmitted from an infected mother to her infant in the birth canal during delivery.
School/Child Care Attendance:
Because of the increased opportunities for spread in the child care setting, management will differ from the school age setting.
Restrictions:
Child Care:
Fever Blisters: Exclude until fever-free and mouth sores are scabbed over and no drooling or exposed open sores.
Genital Herpes: Exclude until fever-free and genital sores are scabbed over.
School:
Fever Blisters: Exclude until fever-free. Mouth sores may still be present.
Genital Herpes: Exclude until fever-free.
Contacts:
No restrictions
Report Required:
No report required.
Special Features:
Both fever blisters and genital herpes are caused by infections with specific types of the Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV). Herpes Simplex type I generally causes infections around the mouth and Herpes Simplex type II generally causes infection in the genital region of the body. However, either type may infect the mouth or genitals.
World-wide, 50-90% of adults have been infected with HSV type I, most before the age of five. Infection with HSV type II generally occurs with sexual activity and is rare before adolescence.
In the case of genital herpes in children, the possibility of sexual abuse cannot be ignored. 65

Good personal and environmental hygiene is important when individuals have fever blisters or genital herpes. Sores should be carefully washed with soap and rinsed with water. Ointments and creams should not be applied unless prescribed by the health care provider. Individuals should be discouraged from picking at sores because the virus is concentrated in the fluid of the blisters. Because eyes can become infected; remind individuals to keep their hands away from their eyes. Do not share items such as face cloths, handkerchiefs, bathing suits, undergarments, or towels which may have come into contact with the virus before laundering.
Health education regarding sexually transmitted diseases (STD’s) such as herpes including signs and symptoms and how they are spread should be included in age appropriate human development curriculum.
Treatment of STD’s is available through local health department clinics and private health care providers. Idaho State Law allows minors age 14 years or older to obtain treatment of STD’s without parental consent. Herpes Simplex may cause life-threatening infections in individuals who are immune compromised in any way.
Dispose of tissues and treatment cotton, swabs, gauze, etc. after one use; use face cloths, napkins, eating utensils, undergarments, etc. with one individual before washing, laundering, or sanitizing thoroughly. Do not share mouthed items or clothing while symptoms are present.
66

Information Letter for Parents Herpes Simplex
Dear Parent:
A child at our school/daycare center has Herpes Simplex infection. What is Herpes Simplex?
Both fever blisters and genital herpes are caused by infections with specific types of Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV). Herpes Simplex type I generally causes infections around the mouth and Herpes Simplex type II generally causes infection in the genital region of the body. However, either type may infect the mouth or genitals.
What are the signs and symptoms?
If your child develops any the symptoms listed below, keep him/her at home and consult with a doctor for diagnosis and treatment. Children must be kept home from school/daycare until they are fever-free and the sores are scabbed over.
Fever blisters (cold sores): Typically, clusters of tiny, fluid-filled blisters on a reddened base of skin around the lips, in the mouth, or on the face. These blisters crust and heal within a few days. Also called “cold sores.”
Genital Herpes: Clusters of very small (pencil-point size) fluid-filled blisters on a reddened base of skin in the genital area.
How can Herpes Simplex be prevented?
Avoid direct contact with saliva, sores or drool from someone who has herpes simplex. Children must also stay home from school/daycare until they are fever-free and the sores are scabbed over.
67

Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV/AIDS)
Signs and Symptoms:
HIV Positive: Evidence of HIV infection in specific blood tests. Most individuals do not develop symptoms of illness for 1-12 years or even longer after infection.
Symptomatic HIV disease: HIV infection with non-specific signs and symptoms such as swelling of lymph nodes, loss of appetite, chronic diarrhea, weight loss, fever, fatigue, and night sweats. These signs and symptoms are not sufficient by themselves to make a diagnosis of AIDS.
AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome): The last stage of HIV infection when the individual becomes very sick. Children with AIDS have difficulty fighting off some common infections and may have unusual infections. In infants and children less than 13 years old, signs may include: failure to grow and develop normally, and recurrent severe bacterial infections.
Immediate Intervention:
Refer to a health care provider for diagnosis.
Incubation Period:
Variable. The incubation period from infection until the diagnosis of AIDS has an observed range of several months to 12 years or longer. In newborns, the disease usually progresses more rapidly than in adults. The period from infection with the virus until results from blood tests are positive for HIV varies from 2 weeks to 6 months. Newborns of HIV-infected mothers will carry maternal antibodies (test positive) for up to 15 months, even though most infants are not themselves infected.
Contagious Period:
Unknown. Presumed to begin early after HIV infection and continues throughout life. Infected individuals are infectious although signs and symptoms may not be present.
Transmission:
Casual contact with an HIV-infected person carries NO RISK of infection. HIV can be transmitted from person-to- person through:
• Sexual intercourse (anal, vaginal, or oral) with an infected individual;
• Sharing HIV-contaminated intravenous needles and syringes used from street drugs, steroids, or
tattoos;
• Through transfusion of infected blood or blood products; a negligible problem since screening of the blood supply began in 1986;
• Careless handling of items contaminated with infected blood or body fluids (bandages, tissues, paper towels, diapers, gloves, sanitary pads, hypodermic needles/syringes);
• An infected mother to her baby in the womb during birth, and through breast milk.
School/Child Care Attendance:
Restrictions:
No restrictions. The benefits of education in an unrestricted setting outweigh the very small risk of transmission of HIV in the school or child care setting. The local health department will assist the school or child care administration and parents in decisions regarding the setting.
Communicable diseases pose a risk to the HIV-infected child. This child’s parents should be alerted to the potential risks of infectious disease in the group setting. If cases of infectious disease such as measles, chickenpox, or whooping cough are identified in the group setting, temporary removal of the HIV-infected child may be recommended.
68

Contacts:
No restrictions.
Report Required:
HIV/AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome) diagnosis
Symptomatic HIV Disease
HIV Positive: Human Immunodeficiency Virus present with or without symptoms
Special Features:
Sources for transmission: blood, semen, vaginal fluid, and breast milk.
HIV-infected adults with no symptoms of illness may care for children in facilities provided they do not have open skin sores or other conditions that would allow contact of their blood or body fluid with children or other adults.
Education should address the fear and misunderstanding about HIV as well as the disease process, routes of transmission (not casually transmitted), and the use of Infection Control Measures.
Schools and child care centers should have procedures in place to provide guidance to all staff responsible for children to prevent the spread of HIV.
Such procedures should include precautions to be taken during the clean-up of blood or body fluid spills. Because HIV infection is often unidentified, the same infection control procedures should be applied to all individuals in the group setting.
Your local health department is available to provide HIV/AIDS training to providers and children.
Impetigo
Signs and Symptoms:
Skin sores which may have a honey-colored, gummy, crusty, or blister-like appearance. Most often seen around the nose and mouth, or on the buttocks of a diapered child. Often itchy.
Immediate Intervention:
Cover with bandage and refer to a health care provider for diagnosis and treatment.
Incubation Period:
Commonly 4-10 days.
Contagious Period:
As long as the untreated sores are present.
Transmission:
Direct contact with the sores, or contaminated hands. Also items that have come into contact with the discharge from the sores such as face cloths, tissues, or diapers.
School/Child Care Attendance:
Because of the increased opportunities for spread in the child care setting, management will differ from the school setting. See Restrictions.
69

Restrictions:
Child Care:
Exclude individuals if the sores cannot be completely covered with a bandage and refer for antibiotic treatment. Can return 24 hours after starting oral antibiotics or 48 hours if only antibiotic ointment is prescribed by the health care provider. Lesions should be kept covered until they are dry.
School:
No attendance restrictions for infected individuals, however the individual should not participate in activities involving direct body contact. Weeping sores should be covered.
Food Handlers:
Exclude from food handling while sores are present. Refer to a health care provider for diagnosis and treatment.
Contacts:
No restrictions.
Report Required:
No report required.
Special Features:
Very contagious. Should be treated with antibiotics. Stress careful hand washing and sanitation procedures. All paper towels, tissues, bandages, and gloves must be disposed of immediately after one use. Proper laundering of contaminated clothing and bed and bath linens must be stressed. Both staphylococcus and streptococcus bacteria can cause impetigo. Infections may be mixed.
  70

Informational Letter for Parents Impetigo
Dear Parent:
A child in our school/daycare center has impetigo. What is Impetigo?
Impetigo is a skin infection, common in young children, and most often occurring on the face and around the mouth.
What does it look like?
Small blisters on the face and hands which form flat, yellow, crusty weeping patches on the skin. These sores grow rapidly in size.
What causes Impetigo?
It is caused by common skin germs which only cause trouble when the skin is injured by a cut, scrape, or scratched insect bite.
How is Impetigo treated?
It is treated with an antibiotic ointment for the sores and/or an oral antibiotic (such as penicillin) to fight the germs causing sores.
1. The sores should be soaked in warm water or warm compresses applied.
2. Crusts should then be removed by applying warm compresses first.
3. Antibiotic ointment should then be applied to the sores.
4. The sores should be covered until they are healed (depending on where they are on the body).
Children should not participate in contact sports until their impetigo has healed. How can the spread of Impetigo be prevented in the school/daycare center?
By promptly treating cases, by excluding untreated children from the school/center until 24-48 hours after they receive treatment, and by making sure anyone who has contact with the sores washes his hands well with soap and water.
What should I do if I think my child has impetigo?
Please consult a physician.
If you have any questions, please call your local health department office or medical provider.

Influenza
Signs and Symptoms:
Sudden onset of fever (102° - 104° F), chills, headache, muscle ache, sore throat, runny nose and cough. Occasional vomiting. Usually recovery in 2-7 days without treatment.
Immediate Intervention:
Exclude.
Incubation Period:
From 24-72 hours.
Contagious Period:
3 days from the onset of signs and symptoms.
Transmission:
Contact with secretions from the nose, mouth, and throat of an infected person. The secretions may be on surfaces or in infected droplets in the air.
School/Child Care Attendance:
Restrictions:
Exclude until symptoms subside and the individual is fever-free.
Contacts:
Should be vaccinated to protect them from possible exposure to the flu. No restrictions.
Reports Required:
None. If there is an unusual absentee rate above 10% in a single group setting with upper respiratory infections, notify the local health department for additional management steps.
Special Features:
Influenza is caused by a virus.
Influenza immunization is recommended each year for adults and children who have chronic health problems. Adults who work with children who have chronic health problems (such as asthma) or who wish to avoid becoming ill with influenza are encouraged to consult their health care provider or local health department regarding this immunization.
Complications can include bacterial pneumonia and Reye’s Syndrome in children. The use of aspirin products for the management of flu symptoms has been associated with Reye’s Syndrome. Therefore, aspirin products are not recommended for fever reduction in children under the age of 18.
72

Informational Letter for Parents Influenza
Dear Parent:
A child in our school/daycare has influenza. Influenza is a virus that is spread thru coughing and sneezing. What causes Influenza?
Influenza is caused by a virus and usually occurs October thru April and is caused by secretions from the nose, mouth, and throat of an infected person. The secretions may be on surfaces or in infected droplets in the air.
What are the signs and symptoms of influenza?
If your child develops any of the symptoms listed below, please keep him/her at home until the child is fever-free.
• Sudden onset of fever (102-104 degrees F)
• Chills
• Headache
• Muscle aches,
• Sore throat
• Runny nose and cough
73

Measles (Rubeola)
Signs and Symptoms:
Fever of 101°F or greater; red, watery eyes; runny nose; cough; and later, a dusk red, blotchy rash that progress from head to toe.
Immediate Intervention:
Isolate, exclude, and refer to a health care provider for diagnosis.
Incubation Period:
About 10 days, varying from 7-18 days from exposure to onset of fever; about 14 days until rash appears.
Contagious Period:
From 4 days before the rash appears to 4 days after the rash appears.
Transmission:
Contact with secretions from the nose, mouth, and throat of an infected individual. These secretions may be on surfaces or in infected droplets in the air. Droplets infected with measles virus can remain in the air for many hours.
School/Child Care Attendance:
Restrictions:
Exclude from the time of onset of illness through the 6th day after rash started, and until the individual is fever-free.
Contacts:
Determine immunity by immunization history or previous blood test.
Any individual who has not received measles vaccine or who cannot prove immunity by immunization or blood test shall not be permitted to attend school or child care for the duration of the period of the outbreak as determined by the local health department.
An outbreak is defined as one (1) case of measles.
Reports Required:
Immediate telephone report to the local health department is required. Case and suspect case reports are also required.
Special Features:
Parents should alert the health care provider of any rash illness before transporting the child to a health care facility, so arrangement can be made to reduce exposure to others.
All suspect cases or diagnosed cases of measles are investigated by the local health department.
Measles can be prevented by age-appropriate immunizations. During community outbreaks, local health department officials may recommend early immunization for infants, which will provide incomplete immunity. For this reason, measles immunizations given before the age of 12 months are not recognized in a routine Immunization Schedule.
Review histories of immunization to identify individuals who are susceptible to measles.
The following persons should receive measles vaccine within 72 hours of exposure to measles. This reduces the chances of becoming ill and allows re-entry into the school or child care setting:
• Any individual who does not have a record (month, day, and year) of receiving age-appropriate doses of measles vaccine;
74

• Individuals with age-appropriate measles immunization who are determined by the local health department to need additional protection against measles;
OR
• Those who do not have a positive blood test (titer) demonstrating immunity to measles.
Future measles immunization schedules may be modified to be consistent with contemporary immunization recommendations.
Contracting measles during pregnancy may be associated with a higher risk of prematurity and miscarriage. A woman who is pregnant and exposed to measles should consult her health care provider.
Measles vaccine is not given during pregnancy.
Rubeola (measles) is also known as: hard measles, red measles, and the 10-day measles.
Meningitis (Hib)
(Haemophilus Influenzae Type B)
Signs and Symptoms:
Onset of signs and symptoms may be gradual, but usually are sudden. High fever, vomiting, and listlessness progressing to coma is common. Occasionally there is mild fever for several days before the onset of other symptoms such as stiff neck, and/or stiff back accompanied by pain, unusual sleepiness, irritability and lack of appetite. A bulging (swollen) fontanelle may be present in infants.
The disease can also cause the following serious infections:
• Meningitis – swelling of the covering of the spinal cord • Cellulitis – swelling of the deep skin tissues
• Epiglottitis – swelling of the epiglottis in the throat
• Pneumonia – infection of the lungs
Immediate Intervention:
Isolate. Immediate medical attention is required.
Incubation Period:
Unknown. Probably short, 2-4 days.
Contagious Period:
As long as the bacteria are present in nose, throat, and mouth secretions.
Transmission:
Contact with infected secretions from the nose, mouth, throat, and ears. These secretions may be on surfaces or in infected droplets in the air.
School/Child Care Attendance:
Restrictions:
Exclude until the individual is symptom-free and the health care provider and local health department indicate the child may return (usually after taking antibiotics for 24 hours).
Contacts:
Rifampin is often given to household and child care contacts.
Reports Required:
Immediate telephone report of cases, suspect cases, and carriers to the local health department. 75

Special Features:
Protective immunizations are recommended for children ages 2 months - 24 months.
Dispose of tissues immediately after one use; use face cloths one time and on only one child before laundering.
Serious complications such as hearing loss, mental retardation, and death may result from delays in seeking medical attention.
In a childcare setting if only 1 child is diagnosed with the disease, household contacts of the child may be treated and treatment may not be recommended for contacts within a child care facility. On the other hand, if two (2) or more cases occur in a child care facility then treatment of children and providers may be warranted. As in all cases, treatment options are up to the physician.
Haemophilus influenzae type b bacteria can also cause sudden and severe throat infections (epiglottitis), pneumonia, ear, skin, and joint infections.
Meningitis may also be caused by a virus (viral meningitis). Viral meningitis is not considered a communicable disease. Also, see Meningitis Meningococcal Disease.
Meningitis Meningococcal Disease
Signs and Symptoms:
Blood Infection: fever, headache, chills, nausea, vomiting, joint or muscle pain, and sometimes a red or purplish rash.
Spinal Fluid Infection (Meningitis): fever, severe headaches, chills, stiff neck, confusion, nausea, and vomiting.
Immediate Intervention:
Isolate, exclude, and refer to a health care provider. Immediate medical attention is required; disease can progress very quickly.
Incubation Period:
Varies from 2-10 days, commonly 3-4 days.
Contagious Period:
As long as the bacteria are present in nose, mouth, and throat secretions.
Transmission:
Contact with secretions from nose, mouth, and throat of an infected person. The secretions may be on surfaces, tissues, mouthed toys, or in infected droplets in the air. Anyone can get the bacteria that causes meningococcal disease, but only a very few people will actually become ill with symptoms.
School/Child Care Attendance:
Restrictions:
Exclude until the individual is symptom-free, receives antibiotic treatment, and the local health department or health care provider indicates the individual may return.
Contacts:
No restrictions. Close observation for early signs of illness. Potentially exposed persons should be instructed to watch for fever, rash, lethargy, irritability, headache, loss of appetite, vomiting or other signs of illness, and told that if signs or symptoms develop within the next two weeks, they should seek medical care immediately. Rifampin is often given to reduce the spread of disease to household, child care, and occasionally close school contacts.
76

Reports Required:
Immediate telephone reports of case, suspect case, and carriers are required.
Special Features:
Most cases occur in older children, teens, and adults.
Dispose of tissues immediately after one use; use face cloths one time and on only one individual before laundering. Serious complications such as hearing loss, mental retardation, and death may result from delays in seeking medical attention. While vaccine for certain types of meningococcal meningitis is available, its use is generally reserved for travelers to areas where the infection is wide-spread, or for controlling outbreaks of the infection.
Meningococcal bacteria are around us all the time. Healthy people may have them in their nose or throat. Usually this does not cause disease. Meningitis may also be caused by a virus (viral meningitis). Viral meningitis is not considered a communicable disease. Also, see Meningitis (Hib).
Molluscum Contagiosum
Signs and Symptoms:
The virus causes small white, pink, or flesh-colored raised bumps or growths with a dimple or pit in the center. The bumps are usually smooth and firm. In most people, the growths range from about the size of a pinhead to as large as a pencil eraser (2 to 5 millimeters in diameter).
The bumps may appear anywhere on the body, alone or in groups. They are usually painless, although they may be itchy, red, swollen and/or sore.
Immediate Intervention:
It is important to keep the area with growths clean and covered with clothing or a bandage so that others do not touch the bumps and become infected with molluscum.
However, when there is no risk of others coming into contact with your skin, such as at night when you sleep, uncover the bumps to help keep your skin healthy. Do not share towels, clothing, or other personal items.
Treatment:
You should discuss all treatment options with a health care provider. Usually no treatment is needed because the bumps disappear by themselves within 6-12 months, although this may take up to 4 years.
Incubation Period:
Little has been verified with regard to the incubation period; however, it is estimated to be between 2 weeks and 6 months. Most cases occur in children over 1 year of age,
Contagious Period:
The virus lives only in the skin and once the growths are gone, the virus is gone and you cannot spread the virus to others.
Transmission:
The virus that causes molluscum is spread from person to person by touching the affected skin. The virus may also be spread by touching a surface with the virus on it, such as a towel, clothing, or toys.
77

School/Child Care Attendance:
Restrictions:
There should be no reason to keep a child with molluscum infection home from day care or school.
Growths not covered by clothing should be covered with a watertight bandage. Change the bandage daily or when obviously soiled.
If a child with bumps in the underwear/diaper area needs assistance going to the bathroom or needs diaper changes, then growths in this area should be bandaged too if possible.
Covering the bumps will protect other children and adults from getting molluscum and will also keep the child from touching and scratching the bumps, which could spread the bumps to other parts of his/her body or cause secondary (bacterial) infections. Ice can alleviate the itchy sensation. A bag of ice wrapped in paper towel can be applied to any area that feels itchy, as long as the ice bag is not used on a sleeping or unattended child.
Contacts:
No restrictions. Proper care of molluscum is required to reduce spread.
Reports Required:
Not required to report, however contact a health professional for treatment advice.
Special Features:
Remind children to wash their hands frequently. See "The Buzz on Scuzz" on the CDC BAM site for handwashing tips.
Molluscum is common enough that you should not be surprised if you see someone with it or if someone in your family becomes infected. Although not limited to children, it is most common in children 1 to 10 years of age. People with weakened immune systems (i.e., HIV-infected persons or persons being treated for cancer) are at higher risk for getting molluscum, and their growths may look different, be larger, and be more difficult to treat.
Mononucleosis (Infectious)
Signs and Symptoms:
Fever, sore throat, listlessness, and swollen lymph nodes in the neck commonly occur. Skin rash may appear on neck and shoulders, or jaundice may develop.
Immediate Intervention:
Refer to a health care provider for diagnosis.
Incubation Period:
From 4-7 weeks.
Contagious Period:
Prolonged. Possibly up to a year or more.
Transmission:
Contact with secretions from the nose, mouth, and throat of an infected person. Most commonly, saliva (spit or drool).
School/Child Care Attendance:
Because of the increased opportunities for spread in the child care setting, management will differ from the school setting. See Restrictions.
 78

Restrictions: Child Care:
Exclude until symptoms are no longer present and the individual is fever-free. In most cases this is about 1-2 weeks.
School:
No attendance restrictions.
Contacts:
No restrictions.
Reports Required:
None.
Special Features:
This viral infection occurs most often in teens and young adults between 15-25 years of age.
Symptoms may last for 2 weeks or longer.
Treatment may include rest with symptomatic treatment for discomfort and fever reduction.
Acetaminophen or other non-aspirin products may be prescribed for fever reduction and the relief of aches and pains.
Special attention to sanitation of mouthed toys is required. Also known as “Kissing Disease”.
79

Informational letter for Parents Mononucleosis
Dear Parent:
A child at our school/daycare center has Mononucleosis. Mononucleosis is a viral infection that most often occurs in teens and young adults between the ages of 15-25 years. Also known as the “kissing disease”.
What causes Mononucleosis?
Mononucleosis is caused by virus and spread from person to person by contact with secretions from the nose, mouth, and throat of an infected person.
What are the signs and symptoms?
The signs and symptoms for Mononucleosis are fever, sore throat, listlessness, and swollen lymph nodes in the neck commonly occur. A skin rash may also develop as well as jaundice. Individuals may not return to school /daycare center until they are fever-free. In most cases this is about 1 to 2 weeks.
80

Mumps (Parotitis)
Signs and Symptoms:
Pain and swelling of one or more of the salivary glands, located in front of the ears. Fever and listlessness may occur.
Immediate Intervention:
Exclude and refer to a health care provider.
Incubation Period:
Usually from 16-18 days, but cases may occur from 12-25 days after exposure.
Contagious Period:
Up to 7 days before swelling to 5 days after swelling appears.
Transmission:
Contact with the secretions of the nose, mouth, and throat of an infected individual. The secretions may be on surfaces or in infected droplets in the air.
School/Child Care Attendance:
Restrictions:
Exclude until swelling subsides and child is fever-free, or for 5 days after the onset of swelling.
Contacts:
No restrictions. Close observation for early signs and symptoms of illness.
Reports Required:
Reporting to the health department is required within three (3) working days of identification.
Special Features:
Mumps is caused by a virus.
Mumps can be prevented by age-appropriate immunization. However, mumps can occur in individuals who have been immunized.
Cases are sometimes seen on high school and college campuses.
Complication of the disease can include painful inflammation of the testes and ovaries, hearing loss, and inflammation of the joints.
Norovirus
Signs and Symptoms:
Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and some stomach cramping. Some individuals may have a low-grade fever, chills, headache, muscle aches and a general sense of tiredness.
Immediate Intervention:
Child should stay at home until he/she is symptom free for 24 hours.
Incubation Period:
The illness may begin 1 to 2 days after exposure and typically only lasts 1 to 2 days. 81

Contagious Period:
Viral shedding may occur during the incubation period but is most commonly associated with the onset of symptoms. Viral shedding may continue for up to 2 weeks after recovery.
Transmission:
Noroviruses are transmitted via the fecal/oral route by consumption of fecally contaminated food, direct person-to- person spread or through contaminated water (drinking or recreational). Vomitus may also be aerosolized and result in droplets which can contaminate surfaces, an individual may touch the contaminated surfaces and introduce the virus into their mouth.
School/Child Care Attendance:
Restrictions:
All individuals with symptoms should be excluded at least until the symptoms are gone. It is recommended that the individual should be symptom free for 24 hours prior to going back into a school or child care setting.
Contacts:
Contacts must not perform food handling duties, or care for children in a child care, if they have signs and symptoms of Norovirus. Since the virus is easily spread from person to person, contacts need to be on the lookout for symptoms and take control measures.
Reports Required:
Report to the health department within one (1) working day of identification.
Special Features:
Norovirus is easily passed from person to person and the chance of coming in contact with the virus can be decreased by:
• Washing hands frequently, especially after toilet visits and changing diapers and before preparing food • Thoroughly cleaning and disinfecting contaminated surfaces immediately using chlorine based cleaner. Note: many household cleaning products contain Quaternary Ammonia which is not effective in killing
Norovirus. A strong chlorine (bleach) solution is the only way to inactivate the virus. Immediately remove and wash clothing or linens that may be contaminated (use hot water and soap).
Pinworms (Enterobiasis)
Signs and Symptoms:
Signs and symptoms may be absent. Often rectal or genital itching is present.
Very small, white, thread-like worms may be seen in stool, on under-clothing and/or on the genital region. Irritation may result from scratching the rectum and/or genital regions. The child may be irritable and sleep may be disturbed.
Immediate Intervention:
If signs and symptoms are present, refer to a health care provider for management which may include medication.
Incubation Period:
The life cycle of pinworms requires 4-6 weeks.
Contagious Period:
As long as the worms or their eggs are present. Eggs can remain infective in the body for up to 2 weeks. 82
 
Transmission:
Swallowing of pinworm eggs. Eggs from the rectum are carried to the mouth on contaminated hands or articles.
School/Child Care Attendance: Restrictions:
No restrictions.
Contacts:
No restrictions.
Reports Required:
None required.
Special Features:
Health education for parents and children:
• Careful hand washing after using the bathroom, diapering a child, and before eating.
• Discourage scratching of the rectum and genitals.
• Keep fingernails short and discourage nail biting and sucking of fingers.
• Recommend daily laundering and change of clothing and bed linen during the course of treatment. Treatment of the whole family at the same time may be advised.
Recurrence is common.
83

Informational Letter for Parents Pinworms
Dear Parent:
A child at our school/daycare center has pinworms. Pinworm infection is the most common intestinal worm infection in the U.S. School-age children are the most often infected group. Parents can get the worms from their infected children.
What are pinworms?
Pinworms are small, less than one-half (1/2) inch long. They live in the human large intestine. They crawl out of the rectum at night to lay their eggs. As they crawl, they cause itching, which can often be irritating and severe enough to disturb someone’s sleep. Itching is often the only symptom of pinworms.
How are pinworms spread from person to person?
Worm eggs are transferred to food or other items taken into the mouth when a person fails to wash hands well after handling contaminated pajamas, underwear or bedding. The infection can also be prolonged when eggs get on the fingers or under the fingernails while scratching the anus during sleep.
How can I tell if my child has pinworms?
By actually seeing the worms (best done at night) or by finding the eggs on the anus. (Your physician or the health department can explain how this is done with cellophane tape).
What is the treatment for pinworms?
There is medication to treat this condition. The whole family should take the medication to kill the worms. Further infection can only be prevented by washing all bedding and clothing in hot water and by carefully washing hands after using the toilet and before eating.
What do I do if I suspect someone in my family has pinworms?
Call your doctor, who can prescribe the proper medication, and wash bedding and clothing.
If you have any questions, please call your local health department office or medical provider.
84

Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV)
Signs and Symptoms:
During the early stages, mild, cold-like signs and symptoms, usually with fever over 102°F for more than 1 day.
Coughing is the most frequent sign. Cough, nasal congestion, and rapid breathing increase and may interfere with sleeping and eating. A sore throat may be present. An ear infection may also be present. Signs and symptoms may last for 1 to 2 weeks.
Immediate Intervention:
Isolate. Refer to a health care provider for diagnosis and treatment.
Incubation Period:
Ranges from 2-8 days; commonly 4-6 days.
Contagious Period:
3-8 days is most common; however, infants may continue shedding this virus for as long as 3-4 weeks.
Transmission:
Contact with secretions from the nose, mouth, and throat of an infected person. The secretions may be on surfaces or in infected droplets in the air.
School/Child Care Attendance: Restrictions:
No exclusion necessary unless:
• Fever Accompanied by behavior change.
• Child has difficulty breathing.
• Child has red or purple rash not associated with injury.
• Child meets routine exclusion criteria
Contacts:
RSV can be spread when an infected person coughs or sneezes into the air, creating virus-containing droplets
that can linger briefly in the air. Other people can become infected if the droplet particles come in contact with their nose, mouth, or eye. Direct (kissing the face of a child with RSV) and indirect (touching a doorknob) transmissions of virus usually occur when people touch an infectious secretion and then rub their eyes or nose.
Reports Required:
A laboratory director must report to the health department with in (1) working day of identification.
Special Features:
RSV usually occurs in yearly outbreaks during winter and early spring. Spread among household and child care contacts, including adults, is common.
Initial infection occurs most commonly during the first year of life. The majority of RSV infections are not serious; however, infants and young children may develop life-threatening illness requiring hospitalization for anti-viral treatment.
Other medical conditions such as asthma and chronic allergies may contribute to an individual’s susceptibility to RSV and other respiratory infections.
A single infection with RSV generally does not make an individual immune to future RSV infections.
RSV infection is not easily distinguishable from other viral infections that cause respiratory signs and symptoms.
85

Informational Letter for Parents Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) Dear Parent:
A child at our school/daycare center has Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV). RSV can cause infections of the upper respiratory tract (like a cold) and the lower respiratory tract (like pneumonia). About half of the infections result in lower respiratory tract infections and otitis media (ear infections). It is the most frequent cause of lower respiratory infections, including pneumonia, in infants and children less than 2 years of age. Almost 100% of children in childcare get RSV in the first year of their life, usually during outbreaks during the winter months.
A RSV infection can range from very mild to life threatening or even fatal. Children with heart or lung disease and weak immune systems are at increased risk of developing severe infection and complications.
RSV is spread by breathing in infected droplets or touching contaminated surfaces. How can Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) be prevented?
The most effective preventative measure against the spread of RSV and other respiratory viral infections is careful and frequent hand washing.
Who is contagious?
A child needs to be excluded from school/daycare center until the child is fever-free and symptoms subside. If you have any questions, please call your local health department office or medical provider.
86

Ringworm
Signs and Symptoms:
Scalp: Begins as a “pimple”, spreads and then become larger, leaving scaly patches of temporary baldness. Skin: Flat, spreading, sores with reddish ring. May be dry and scaly, or moist and crusted. Itching is common.
Immediate Intervention:
Minimize contact with others until it is treated. Cover exposed sores with a bandage if practical. Refer to a health care provider. Complete treatment as instructed even after symptoms disappear.
Incubation Period: Unknown Contagious Period:
If not treated it will be contagious as long as sores are present. Transmission:
Direct contact with the sores or articles contaminated with the fungus. Animals including dogs, cats, and cattle can be a source of infection. Ringworm is not caused by a “worm;” it is caused by a fungus.
School/Child Care Attendance: Restrictions:
Exclude until 24 hours after treatment begins.
Contacts:
Examine close contacts and exclude if infected. Parents may seek veterinary assistance in examining and obtaining treatment for infected household pets.
Reports Required:
None required.

Occasionally, 2 treatments one week apart may be required to eliminate the infestation. Follow directions for treatment. Improper or excessive use of treatment may cause toxic effects.
Itching may continue for weeks after treatment is complete.
Scratching may result in bacterial skin infections.
Environmental pesticide sprays are not recommended for management.
Wash and dry, on the hot cycle, all washable items that the individual may have come into contact with in the previous 3 days. Include bed linens, towels, and clothes.
Mites can burrow under the skin in 2 minutes.
93

Informational Letter for Parents Scabies
Dear Parent:
A child at our school/daycare center has Scabies. Scabies is caused by a microscopic mite, Sarcoptes scabei. Scabies infestation does require treatment so you will need to contact your healthcare provider.
What causes Scabies?
Scabies is an infection of the skin with the microscopic mite Sarcoptes scabei. Infestation is common, found worldwide and affects people of all races and social classes.
What are the signs and symptoms?
The following are the signs and symptoms of scabies infestation:
• Pimple-like irritations, burrows or rash of the skin, especially in the skin folds, between fingers, shoulder blades etc.
• Intense itching, especially at night and over most of the body.
• Sores on the body that have become infected due to scratching.
How can I prevent scabies?
Scabies is passed by direct, prolonged, skin-to-skin contact with a person already infested with scabies. Contact must be prolonged (a quick handshake or hug will not spread infestation).
Children have to be kept out of school/daycare centers until 24 hours after initial treatment.
94

Shigella (Shigellosis)
Signs and Symptoms:
Diarrhea (sometimes with blood or mucus), fever, nausea, abdominal cramps, and sometimes vomiting.
Immediate Intervention:
Child should stay home until he/she has received treatment from a physician.
Incubation Period:
From 12 hours to 7 days, usually 1-3 days
Contagious Period:
From the time they first get sick until about one month after symptoms began. Treatment with antibiotics usually reduces the time a person is able to spread the disease to less than a week.
Transmission:
Contaminated water, raw milk, food, and infected animals and people transmit this illness. The germs are in the stool of anyone who is infected. The germs may get on the infected person’s hands when they use the toilet or germs may go to the hands of a caregiver changing an infected child’s diaper. From the contaminated hands, the germs may be spread to another person, or they may contaminate something which might end up in the child’s mouth (toys or food).
School/Child Care Attendance:
Restrictions:
All individuals with diarrhea should be excluded. If laboratory studies confirm the presence of Shigella (Shigellosis), the individual should be excluded from the group setting until 2 approved fecal specimens have been collected at least 24 hours apart and are both negative for Shigella.
Contacts:
Contacts may not perform food handling duties, or care for children in a child care center, if signs and symptoms of
Shigella are present.
Screening of other contacts that do not have signs or symptoms is not recommended.
Reports Required:
Reporting of all cases is required. Please contact the Health Department within one (1) working day.
Special Features:
Infected individuals with mild symptoms or without signs or symptoms can spread this disease by poor hygiene habits. This illness is often spread from child to child in diapered groups. Stress careful hand washing after toileting, after changing diapers and before food preparation and eating.
Staphylococcal Infections
Signs and Symptoms:
Infection can be minor (such as pimples, boils and other skin conditions) or serious and sometimes fatal (such as blood infections or pneumonia). Localized staph infection is confined to a ring of dead and dying while blood cells and bacteria. The skin will feel warm to the touch.
95

Immediate Intervention:
A family physician should be notified whenever: A boil or carbuncle appears on any part of the face or spine (staph infections affecting these areas can spread to the brain or spinal cord); a boil becomes very sore is usually a sign that infection has spread and may become accompanied by fever, chills, and red streaks radiating from the site of the original infection; boils that develop repeatedly could become a symptom of diabetes.
Contagious Period:
From when signs appear until 24 hours after antibiotic treatment has begun.
Transmission:
To avoid spreading this disease, practice good hand washing after touching open sores or coming into contact with someone who has open sores. Use of infection control practices (such as wearing gloves before and after contact with infectious body tissues and proper hand washing) can reduce the spread. Appropriate use of antibiotics (i.e., use only when needed to treat bacterial infections and avoid overuse) will reduce the emergence of resistance strains.
School/ Child Care Attendance:
Restrictions:
All children with signs of this illness need to be excluded until 24 hours after antibiotic treatment has begun and only if lesions can be adequately covered with a bandage.
Contacts:
Anyone who has contact with a child that has open sores should make sure they practice good hand washing techniques and wear gloves if they are going to have contact with open sores.
Reports Required:
The Health Department does not need to be contacted. However, inform parents of all children in the facility who may have been exposed.
96

Informational Letter to Parents Staphylococcal Infections
Dear Parent:
A child at our school/daycare center has a Staphylococcal infection. Staphylococcal infections can be minor (such as pimples, boils and other skin conditions) or serious and sometimes fatal (such as blood infections or pneumonia).
What do I need to watch for?
A family physician should be notified whenever: a boil or carbuncle appears on any part of the face or spine; a boil becomes very sore, which is usually a sign that infection has spread and may become accompanied by fever, chills, and red streaks radiating from the site of the original infection.
How can Staphylococcal infections be prevented?
All children with signs of Staphylococcal illness need to be excluded for 24 hours after antibiotic treatment is started and lesions cam be adequately covered with a bandage. To avoid spreading the illness, good hand washing needs to be practiced after touching open sores or coming into contact with someone who has open sores.
97

School/Child Care Attendance:
Restrictions:
Exclude for at least 48 hours after the first dose of oral antibiotics or 24 hours after antibiotic injection and until the individual is fever-free.
Contacts:
Observe for early signs and symptoms of illness.
Reports Required:
No report required.
Special Features:
Scarlet fever is the result of toxin produced by certain kind of streptococcal bacteria. Treatment is usually the same as for strep throat.
Streptococcal bacteria are responsible for other infections such as impetigo, and ear infections. Left untreated, streptococcal infections may damage the kidneys or heart (rheumatic fever). Infections are usually seasonal, with most cases in the winter months.
Dispose of tissues immediately after one use; use face cloths one time and on only one individual before laundering.

Informational Letter for Parents Streptococcal (Strep) Infections Dear Parent:
A child in our school/daycare center has streptococcal (strep) infection.
What are the symptoms?
The first signs of illness will occur 1 to 3 days after your child has been exposed to the infection.
A sudden onset of red sore throat, fever, listlessness, swollen glands, nausea, and headache. The throat may be coated with white spots and then become bright red.
Who is contagious?
A child needs to be excluded from school/daycare center for at least 48 hours after the first dose of oral antibiotics or 24 hours after an antibiotic injection and until the individual is fever-free.
If you have any questions, please call your local health department office or medical provider.

Thrush/Yeast Diaper Rash
Signs and Symptoms:
Thrush: Creamy white patches resembling cottage cheese curds inside the mouth and on the tongue. When scraped, these spots leave a raw, bleeding, painful sore. Seen most often in infants and immunocompromised individuals.
Yeast Diaper Rash: Bright red rash in the diaper area. The infected skin may peel or develop open sores.
Immediate Intervention:
If signs and symptoms are present, refer to a health care provider for management which may include medication.
Incubation Period:
Variable; 2-5 days for thrush in infants.
Contagious Period:
While sores are present.
Transmission:
Thrush: Contact with secretions from the mouth and throat of an infected individual. Yeast Diaper Rash: Contact with the skin and stool of an infected individual.
School/Child Care Attendance:
Restrictions:
Children who are being treated with medication prescribed or recommended by a health care provider for thrush or yeast diaper rash do not need to be excluded.
Contacts:
No restrictions.
Reports Required:
None. If there is an unusual infection rate (3 or more individuals in a classroom with Thrush or Yeast diaper rash) notify the local health department for additional management steps.
Special Features:
Both Thrush and Yeast diaper rash are caused by various kinds of Candida yeast.
When caring for children with thrush, special attention must be given to items contaminated with the saliva of infected children such as bottles, feeding utensils, pacifiers, mouthed toys, bibs, and clothing wet with drool, and medication implements. Pay special attention to cleaning and sanitizing mouthed items and equipment that belongs to the facility.
Place the child’s personal items in a plastic bag, label with the child’s name, and send home for cleaning. Make sure the child’s bottle and pacifier are labeled and not “shared” with another child. Advise breastfeeding mothers to wash nipples before and after nursing.
Children with yeast diaper rash must have their diapers changed immediately after they become wet or soiled.
The child’s bottom should be cleaned with soap and water, rinsed well, and gently patted dry. Avoid the use of corn starch, powders, ointments, and diaper wipes containing alcohols they can further irritate the skin and cause discomfort. Use only the ointments or medications recommended or prescribed by the child’s health care provider. Clean and sanitize diaper changing surfaces well.
100

Careful hand washing after contact with affected areas or secretions, or items contaminated with secretions, is important.

Informational Letter for Parents Thrush/Yeast Diaper Rash
Dear Parent:
A child at our school/daycare center has Thrush. Both Thrush and Yeast diaper rash are caused by various kinds of Candida yeast.
What causes Thrush/Yeast Diaper Rash?
Most cases of Thrush (in the oral cavity) and Yeast Diaper Rash are caused by a person’s own Candida that normally live in the mouth or digestive tract. A child will have symptoms when there is too much growth of the Candida.
What are the signs and symptoms?
Thrush: Creamy white patches resembling cottage cheese curds inside the mouth and on the tongue. When scraped, these spots leave a raw, bleeding, painful sore. This illness is seen most often in infants and people with compromised immune systems.
Yeast Diaper Rash: Bright red rash in the diaper area. The infected skin may peel or develop open sores.
Children who are being treated with medication prescribed or recommended by a health care provider for thrush or yeast diaper rash do not need to be excluded.
102

Tuberculosis (Pulmonary)
Signs and Symptoms:
Cough, low fever, weight loss, night sweats, chest pain. The cough may produce bloody sputum. There may be no symptoms, particularly in young children.
Immediate Intervention:
Refer to a health care provider for diagnosis and treatment.
Incubation Period:
May be from months to a lifetime. The time from infection to development of a positive tuberculin skin test or identification of disease on X-ray may range from 2-10 weeks.
Contagious Period:
As long as living bacteria are in the sputum.
Transmission:
Breathing in infected droplets that come from the nose, mouth, and throat of an infected individual. These droplets are transmitted through the air when an infected person exhales, coughs, sneezes, talks, laughs, or sings. The infected droplets are then breathed in by other individuals. Risk is greatest for individuals sharing airspace for prolonged period of time.
School/Child Care Attendance:
Restrictions:
Exclude until laboratory examination of sputum demonstrates tuberculosis bacteria are no longer present or according to more specific guidelines established by the local health department.
Contacts:
The local health department will assist in completing investigation and screening of household, school, and child care contacts. The local health department will provide information regarding management guidelines for TB.
Reports Required:
Case and suspect case reports are required within one (1) working day of identification.
Special Features:
In areas where TB is prevalent, skin testing may identify individuals who are infected. Foreign-born adults and children show increased rates of infection, as do individuals with HIV infection, close contacts of individuals with TB infection, and residents of long-term care facilities. Communities may also identify specific groups in their area where an increased rate of tuberculosis exists (e.g., homeless populations or migrant farm workers).
Group care programs may contact their local health department for advice on developing health policies regarding tuberculosis testing for staff, volunteers, and children.
The TB skin test is a screening test – not an immunization against tuberculosis.
103

Whooping Cough (Pertussis)
Signs and Symptoms:
Mild, cold-like signs and symptoms accompanied by little or no fever.
Coughing, which gets worse within 1-2 weeks and becomes spasmodic. The cough may be followed by a “whooping sound” in older infants and preschool children.
Coughing will include increased production of mucus. After episodes of coughing, vomiting may occur.
Immediate Intervention:
Isolate and exclude. Refer to a health care provider for diagnosis and treatment.
Incubation Period:
Commonly 7 days; does not exceed 21 days.
Contagious Period:
Most contagious during the cold-like stage to 3 weeks after the cough begins, or until on effective antibiotic therapy for a minimum of 5 days.
Transmission:
Contact with secretions of the nose, mouth, and throat of an infected individual. These secretions may be on surfaces or in infected droplets in the air.
School/Child Care Attendance:
Restrictions:
Untreated individuals must be excluded for 3 weeks following the onset of “hard” coughing. Individuals taking antibiotics may return after 5 days of medication if their condition allows and the individual is fever-free; cough may still be present.
Contacts:
A preventive course of antibiotics is often recommended for household contacts and close contacts. The local health department will assist in investigating and prescribing a course of action for group settings.
Reports Required:
Immediate telephone report of cases and suspect cases to the local health department are required.
Special Features:
Whooping Cough (Pertussis) is a vaccine-preventable disease.
Review immunization histories of all children to identify those who need additional vaccination when a case occurs in the group setting.
Immunity provided by vaccinations begins to diminish during the teenage years, making teens and adults susceptible to whooping cough.
Whooping cough vaccine is not given to individuals 7 years of age or older at this time.
Whooping cough is often misdiagnosed as bronchitis or other respiratory illness in teens and adults.

Hazardous Materials in Child Care
Children are much more vulnerable than adults to exposures of hazardous materials because their bodies are developing; they eat more, drink more, and breathe more in proportion to their body size; and their behavior, such as crawling and hand-to-mouth activity, can expose them more to chemicals and infectious diseases.2 Many types of infectious germs may be contained in human waste (urine, feces) and body fluids (saliva, nasal discharge, tissue and injury discharges, eye discharges, blood, and vomit).3
There are more than two million human poison exposures reported to poison centers every year. Children younger than 6 years account for more than half of those potential poisonings. The substances most commonly involved in children’s poison exposures are cosmetics and personal care products, cleaning substances, and medications.4 Exposure to a toxic substance can occur if certain chemicals are inhaled or ingested or contact the skin. The phone number 1-800-222-1222, the universal number for all 55 Poison Control Centers in the United States, should be posted in readily visible locations near telephones and added to teachers’ cell phones in the event an accidental poisoning occurs.
Carbon monoxide is a deadly, colorless, odorless, poisonous gas; you cannot see, taste, or smell it. Young children are especially vulnerable to the effects of carbon monoxide because of their smaller bodies. Children process carbon monoxide differently than adults, may be more severely affected by it, and may show signs of poisoning sooner. In 2009, poison control centers reported more than 3,551 cases of carbon monoxide exposure in children 19 years and younger.5 Carbon monoxide is produced by the incomplete burning of various fuels, including coal, wood, charcoal, oil, kerosene, propane, and natural gas. Using a carbon monoxide detector is the only way to identify whether this substance is at a dangerous level.6
Lead is a neurotoxin. Even at low levels of exposure, lead can cause reduction in a child’s IQ and attention span, and result in reading and learning disabilities, hyperactivity, and behavioral difficulties. Lead poisoning has no cure. These effects cannot be reversed once the damage is done, affecting a child’s ability to learn, succeed in school, and function later in life. Other symptoms of low levels of lead in a child’s body are subtle behavioral changes, irritability, low appetite, weight loss, sleep disturbances, and shortened attention span.7,8 The sources of lead can be any of the following: water impacted by pipes that are made of lead or copper, soil, flaking paint chips, and toys.

Immunizations
Idaho Code, Chapter 11, Section 39-1118:
39-1118. Immunization required. (1) Within fourteen (14) days of a child's initial attendance at any licensed daycare facility, the parent or guardian shall provide an immunization record to the operator of the daycare facility regarding the child's immunity to certain childhood diseases. This record, signed by a physician or his representative or another licensed health care professional, shall verify that the child has received or is in the process of receiving immunizations as specified by the board; or can effectively demonstrate, through verification in a form approved by the department, immunity gained through prior contraction of the disease.
Immunizations required and the manner and frequency of their administration shall be as prescribed by the board and shall conform to recognized standard medical practices in the state. The board shall promulgate appropriate rules for the enforcement of the required immunization program and specify reporting requirements of daycare facilities, pursuant to the provisions of chapter 52, title 67, Idaho Code.
(2) Any minor child whose parent or guardian has submitted to officials of a licensed daycare facility a certificate signed by a physician licensed by the state board of medicine stating that the physical condition of the child is such that all or any of the required immunizations would endanger the life or health of the child shall be exempt from the provisions of this section. Any minor child whose parent or guardian has submitted a signed statement to officials of the daycare facility stating their objections on religious or other grounds shall be exempt from the provisions of this section.
Immunization rules for child care facilities can be found at:
http://adminrules.idaho.gov/rules/current/16/0211.pdf
Retention of records by the child care provider is described in section 200. of these rules.
200. DOCUMENTATION AND RETENTION OF IMMUNIZATIONS RECORD BY LICENSED DAYCARE FACILITY OPERATORS.
01. Provision of Information. The licensed daycare facility operator will provide to the parent, custodian, or
guardian, information on immunization requirements and the ACIP recommended immunization schedule. (4-7-11) 02. Immunization Record Retention. The immunization documentation described in Section 102 of these rules, must be retained by the licensed daycare facility for each child as long as the child attends the licensed daycare facility plus one (1) year after last attendance. (4-7-11)

Immunization Requirements
The Child Care Providers Role in Immunizations
Under Idaho Code 39-1118 and IDAPA 16.02.11 (previous page) all licensed childcare providers are required to keep immunization records on file for each child. Keeping the records on file and up-to-date on every child is part of the health and safety inspection process by the health district staff. Failure to have the immunization records on file or up-to-date could result in license denial until compliance is met.
Parents are required to provide proof of immunization or documentation of exemption from receiving immunizations within 14 days of enrollment. The primary purpose of this law is to protect the health and well- being of ALL children in childcare.
   113

What the State Law Requires the Childcare Provider to Do
a. Keep updated records of immunizations on file for all children who attend the childcare facility. The record must include:
1. Child’s name and date of birth
2. Type of vaccine given (DTP, DTaP, MMR, etc)
3. Date each dose was given (month/day/year)
4. Signature (or Stamp) of the physician, a physician’s representative, or the health department
5. The signature of the parent or guardian
b. Update the records as additional immunizations are given. Review records routinely to ensure immunizations are current for all children.
Immunizations That Are Required by State Law
IMMUNIZATION REQUIREMENTS. All immunizations listed in Subsections 100.01 through 100.09 of these rules, are required of children who attend licensed daycare facilities. These immunizations must be administered age appropriately according to the “ACIP Recommended Schedule,” incorporated by reference in Section 004 of these rules, unless fewer doses are medically recommended by a physician.
01. Diphtheria, Tetanus and A-Cellular Pertussis (DTaP) Vaccine 02. Polio Vaccine.
03. Measles, Mumps, and Rubella (MMR) Vaccine.
04. Haemophilus Influenza Type B (HIB) Vaccine.
05. Hepatitis B Vaccine. 06. Varicella Vaccine.
07. Pneumococcal Vaccine. 08. Rotavirus Vaccine.
09. Hepatitis A Vaccine.
The current immunization schedule can be accessed at http://www.immunize.org/cdc/schedules/
Children must be appropriately immunized for his/her age within 14 days of attending a child care facility. A child who is not appropriately immunized must begin the needed immunizations within 14 of first attending the childcare facility and proof of immunizations given to the child care provider. Failure for a parent to provide this required information within 14 days should result in their child be excluded from attending the childcare facility until the information is received.
It is important that children receive these shots for their own improved health and also for the safety of the other children (and adults) at the childcare center. If all children are immunized, it is less likely the diseases will spread to others.
Exemptions and Exceptions to the Law
Children are not required under Idaho Code to be immunized if the parent provides written, signed documentation of the following:
1. Written medical proof of the child’s immunity to any of the above nine diseases or a physician’s statement that the child previously had been diagnosed and treated for Measles, Mumps, or Rubella
2. Written statement from a licensed physician that the child’s life or health would be at risk if any or all of the required immunizations were given.
3. Written statement from the parent(s) of religious or personal objections to the required immunizations. 114
 
If a child is not immunized for one of the above reasons, the parent must provide written documentation within 14 days of enrolling the child in childcare. Only Idaho Department of Health and Welfare Exemption forms will be accepted. This written documentation must be retained in the childcare provider’s immunization file in order to meet the childcare licensing requirements.
A childcare provider has the right to develop operating policies/procedures for the home/center that are more stringent than Idaho Code (state law). A child care provider is not “required” under law to accept children into a home/center who are not immunized. If the facility chooses to develop such a policy, it would be best to discuss the requirement and personal belief about the timely immunizations with parents during the interview with the parents. This will eliminate any chance of misunderstanding in the future around the issue. Parents who sign an exemption form for the child should be informed that their child may be excluded from day care if one of the nine vaccine preventable diseases occur in the facility and there is no proof on file that the child has received vaccine or is immune to the disease.
Other Things the Childcare Provider Can Do
Communication. The childcare provider has a key role and opportunity to help promote the health of the children in the home/center. Children who receive their immunizations on time are healthier children. Unlike the pediatrician or health care provider, the childcare provider sees parents on a daily basis and can make use of those opportunities to remind them of needed immunizations. They can help educate parents by becoming familiar with the vaccines, the health benefits for children, and knowing where in the community parents can go for free or low-cost immunizations or to get more information about vaccines. For more information, contact the health department offices. The Parents Guide for Immunizations is on page 119.
The “14” Vaccine Preventable Diseases
Immunization prevents the following 14 serious infections that can cause disease, disability, and death. These diseases used to strike thousands of children each year. Today there are relatively few cases, but outbreaks still occur each year because some babies are not immunized.
Except where noted, these diseases spread when viruses or bacteria pass from an infected person to the nose or throat of others.
1. Diphtheria: This infectious disease is a bacterium that lives in the mouth, throat, and nose of a person infected with the disease and is spread by coughing or sneezing. Early symptoms are a sore throat, a slight fever, chills, and difficulty swallowing. A membrane develops and can block the airway, making it impossible to breathe. Complications of the disease are suffocation, paralysis, heart failure, coma, and death. Before the vaccine, diphtheria caused as many as 15,520 deaths in children during 1 year
2. Tetanus (lockjaw): Tetanus is caused by a toxin (poison) produced by a bacteria found in soil, dust, manure, and in the digestive tract of humans and many animals. Tetanus is not spread from person to person, but enters the body through a cut or wound. Early symptoms include a headache, irritability, and stiffness in the jaw, neck, arms, legs and abdomen. Complications of the disease are broken bones from muscle spasms, breathing problems, severe heart damage, lung infections, coma, and death. At least 30% of Americans who get tetanus die.
3. Pertussis (whooping cough): Pertussis is caused by a bacterium that lives in the mouth, nose, and throat of an infected person and is highly contagious. It is spread by coughing and sneezing. Symptoms include a thick, sticky mucous in the windpipe and can cause spells of violent coughing and choking, making it hard to breathe, drink, or eat. The cough can last for weeks. Most cases occur in children under five years of age. Pertussis is most serious for infants under one year of age, who can get pneumonia, have seizures, become brain damaged, or even die. Before the vaccine, between 150,000 and 260,000 cases of Pertussis were reported each year.
4. Polio: Polio is caused by a virus that lives in the intestinal tract or throat of an infected person and is spread by contact with the feces (bowel movement) of an infected person. Symptoms can include sudden fever, sore throat, headache, muscle weakness, and pain. Many people who are infected with the polio virus have no symptoms but can spread it to others. Complications of the disease are deformed or
115

paralyzed legs and arms, inability to breathe, and death. Before the vaccine, 13,000 to 20,000 cases of paralytic polio were reported each year in the United States; many children were left on crutches, in braces, in wheelchairs, and on iron lungs.
5. Measles: Rubeola, also called the hard measles or 10-day measles is highly contagious and is spread by coughing, sneezing, or by simply talking to someone who has measles. Even being in the same room with a person with measles is enough to catch the disease. Symptoms include a rash that begins on the hairline and moves downward on the body, high fever, cough, and watery eyes. Complications of the disease are pneumonia, ear infections, brain damage, seizures, and death. Pregnant women who get measles can miscarry or give birth prematurely. One of the most infectious diseases in the world; if measles vaccinations were stopped, it is estimated that 2.7 million people would die worldwide.
6. Mumps: The mumps is a common childhood disease that is spread by coughing, sneezing, or talking to someone who has the mumps. Symptoms include swollen glands and cheeks, fever, and headaches. Complications of the disease are deafness, brain damage, and swelling of the testicles and sterility in male teens and adults.
7. Rubella (German Measles): The rubella virus is spread through coughing, sneezing, or talking with someone who has rubella. It usually causes mild discomfort including fever for about 24 hours, and a rash on the face and neck that lasts for about 3 days. Adults who get rubella may have swollen glands in the back of the neck and some pain, swelling, or stiffness in the joints. Although rubella is generally a mild childhood disease, the greatest danger is to a pregnant woman which can cause her to lose her unborn baby, or the baby can be born blind, deaf, or mentally retarded, or with heart defects or other serious problems. During 1964 and 1965, before the vaccine, of the 20,000 infants born with rubella syndrome, 11,600 were deaf, 3580 were blind, and 1800 were mentally retarded.
8. Haemophilus influenza b Meningitis: Haemophilus influenza b (HIB) virus causes meningitis and is caused by bacteria rather than a virus like the “flu”. It usually starts in the nose and throat. Symptoms are fever, headache, vomiting, and breathing problems. Complications of disease are meningitis, blindness, brain damage, paralysis, hearing loss, and death. This disease is very serious for children younger than 5 years of age, especially infants. Before the vaccine, HIB meningitis killed 600 children each year and left many survivors with deafness, seizures, or mental retardation.
9. Hepatitis B: Hepatitis B is an infection of the liver caused by a virus. It spreads through contact with blood or other body fluids of an infected person. This can happen through sexual contact or by sharing a razor, toothbrush, or needles used to inject drugs; can also be contracted through tattooing and body piercing. Hepatitis B causes loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, stomach pain and swelling, fever, headaches, weakness, and jaundice (yellowing of the eyes and skin). An infected pregnant woman can expose her newborn to this virus during birth. The virus stays in the liver of some people for the rest of their lives making the person a “carrier” who can infect others throughout their life. Complications of the disease are permanent liver damage, cancer of the liver cirrhosis, and death. Approximately 25% of children who develop lifelong hepatitis b infection die of related liver diseases as adults. It is estimated that there is more than one million carriers of Hepatitis B in the United States.
10. Varicella (chicken pox): the disease is spread by coughing, sneezing, or contact with chicken pox sores; usually occurs in children younger than 10 years of age. Symptoms are itchy rash over entire body with many sores, fever, and sore throat. Complications of disease are lung damage, brain damage, and death; can be especially dangerous for teens and young adults. Before the vaccine, an estimated 4 million people got chicken pox, causing 11,000 hospitalizations and 100 deaths each year.
11. Pneumococcus: Pneumococcus is spread through coughing and sneezing of an infected person. Symptoms include fever, chills and shaking, chest pain, coughing, fast heartbeat, fast breathing or difficulty breathing. Complications of disease are pneumonia, meningitis, sepsis (an infection of the blood), brain damage, ear and sinus infections.
12. Hepatitis A: can occur anywhere in the world. Immunization is especially recommended for those 2 years of age and older who participate in a childcare settings or anyone traveling to certain areas of the world. It is spread by eating contaminated food or drinking contaminated water usually in developing countries;
116

however, because hepatitis A thrives in unsanitary conditions involving food preparation, it can also occur in the United States. Symptoms include loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, stomach pain, jaundice (yellow skin and eyes), fever, headaches, and dark urine. Complications of disease are low energy levels up to one year, hospitalization, and death, especially in those already suffering from liver disease.
13. Influenza: is spread by coughing or sneezing by an infected person. Symptoms include high fever, chills, severe muscle aches, and headaches. Complications of disease are pneumonia, swelling of the brain, and death. Before the vaccine, from 1918 to 1919, there were 550,000 deaths due to influenza in the United States; 21 million died worldwide.
14. Rotavirus; These are intestinal viruses that infect virtually all children by three years of age. It is the most common cause of diarrhea in children, including hospital-acquired diarrhea; childcare center outbreaks are common. The illness often also includes fever and vomiting, lasts a week or longer, and can cause persistent infection in immunocompromised people. Most rotavirus infections are mild, but about 1 in 50 cases develop severe dehydration.

 Childcare Immunization Requirements
Immunizing our children is a great way to keep them happy and healthy.
To attend a licensed childcare facility in Idaho, a child must receive the required immunizations outlined below no later than the age-deadline specified.
This means a child has received all of the doses of each vaccine appropriate for the child's age.
Parents/guardians must present their child’s immunization record to the childcare provider within 14 days of the child’s initial attendance.
1. DTaP: The 5th dose is not necessary if the 4th dose was administered at age 4 years or older.
2. Polio: The 4th dose is not necessary if the 3th dose was administered at age 4 years or older and at least 6 months after previous dose.
3. HIB: Generally not recommended for children aged 5 years or older.
4. Pneumococcal: Generally not recommended for children aged 5 years or older. Children aged 14 through 59 months who
received a completed 4-dose or
other age-appropriate series of PCV7, must also receive a supplemental dose of PCV13.
5. Rotavirus: Vaccination should not be initiated for infants aged 15 weeks 0 days or older. The maximum age for the final dose is 8 months.

 Idaho’s Immunization Registry System - A Note for Parents
Parents and providers understand how hard it can be to know if a child has been fully immunized. New vaccines become available, the number of doses needed changes, and it can be almost impossible to know if a child is protected. Since up to 5 clinic visits before age 2 may be needed, it’s a dizzying task!
Help is here. Idaho’s IRIS (Immunization Reminder Information System) is a convenient way for parents to make sure their child is fully immunized. At the parent’s direction, health care providers in Idaho will be able to share an electronic confidential immunization record. This is especially important if you move somewhere else in Idaho or change where your child receives health care.
Especially for parents... Idaho’s IRIS is a statewide system designed to help you and your healthcare provider keep track of your child’s immunization status. The computerized system will contain up to date information about your child’s immunization history. The information on your child’s dates of immunization will be accessible only to you, your doctor, your health district, and your child’s school or childcare. By using IRIS, you and your child’s doctor will be able to check what immunizations are needed and at what age. How do I get my child into IRIS? Participation in IRIS is Automatic. Your signature is needed to not enroll your child in IRIS. Your doctor and health district have forms you can complete.
What information about my child will be in IRIS? The immunizations your child has already received entered at the time your child receives future immunizations. Other information will be included to be sure your child’s records are accurate and will not be confused with another child’s such as: mother’s maiden name, child’s gender, parent or guardian’s telephone number and other data that may help to determine if your child is eligible for free vaccine.
Who will have access to this information about my child? The information about your child will be kept confidential under law. If you sign an enrollment form, the information will be shared only with you and your child’s healthcare providers, childcare providers and schools. It will not be shared with any other individuals or agencies. By advising your doctor or health district, you also may later decide to omit all information regarding your child from IRIS.
How will IRIS help my child? Your child’s doctor and nurse routinely collect and keep immunization information about your child in their office. By signing this form, you permit IRIS to store information on the immunizations your child has received.
Even if you move somewhere else in Idaho or change where your child receives health care, IRIS will permit a new healthcare provider to quickly access your child’s immunization records and remind you when immunizations are due. These reminders will be sent to you either from your child’s doctor or a local health district office.
IRIS also will make it easy for you to obtain a copy of your child’s immunization record when it is required for childcare, school, camp or other activities. It also will help make sure your child is receiving his or her recommended immunizations at the right time.
Remember, Idaho’s IRIS is confidential, and secure. The immunization record will be used only to ensure children are protected from vaccine preventable diseases by making sure they are fully immunized as soon as possible. For more information about IRIS, ask your doctor or local health department.

Pets
Pets can be a source of disease germs to humans. They can also become serious nuisances from bites, scratches, noise and general sanitation problems. Proper control of pets in your child care is important for the overall health and safety of the children. Hands should always be washed after children have contact with the pet, pet food, pet cages, or pet toys. Diarrhea (calf scours and guinea pig wet bottom) in young animals usually indicates a sick animal, which must be isolated from children.
Dogs
Dogs can be sources of disease germs, parasites, and bites. For these reasons, dogs should not be allowed where there is a congregation of people, especially children. Dogs should be excluded from all areas that the children use. Dog urine and droppings can infect play areas and food even when dogs are present.
Cats
Cats can also be sources of germs, parasites, and bites. Like dogs, cats should not be allowed to use the common areas of the child care setting. This includes playgrounds, food areas, all rooms and play areas.
Turtles & Reptiles
Turtles and tortoises are sources of a germ called Salmonella. This germ can make people very sick. The sale of pet turtles smaller than 6” is illegal. They should not be kept at your child care center.
Birds
Birds in the parrot family such as macaws, turbans, parrots, cockatoos, and parakeets also require strict control to prevent the spread of germs which these birds can carry. They are not recommended as pets in a child care center.
Fish
Fish may be kept as pets in child care centers, but should be kept away from food areas and should not be of the variety, which may bite or is poisonous.
Hamsters, Gerbils, Guinea Pigs, Rats, and Rabbits
Hamsters, gerbils, and guinea pigs may be kept as pets in a child care center if precautions are taken to minimize problems. They should be kept away from all areas where food and drink are prepared or consumed and should not be accessible to children under 4 years of age. Cages should be built so that the litter can easily be cleaned. The cage grating must be small enough that children cannot put their fingers into the cage. Common sense should be used in keeping cages clean and also in preventing access to children who put their hands in their mouth.
Ferrets, Bats, Wild Animals, and Snakes
It is strongly recommended that facilities not keep or bring in ferrets, or any wild or dangerous animals.
Bats in Idaho are a source of deadly rabies. Do not touch any bat. Use heavy leather gloves or tools if you must move a bat. If a bat is found on the ground, cover it with a box, keep children away and contact animal control.
126

Animal Bites
Immediate Intervention:
Wash all bites and scratches with soap and water. Refer the individual immediately to a health care provider or emergency care facility to determine if anti-rabies treatment is needed.
Persons who may have been exposed to rabies can receive a series of vaccinations in the arm to prevent illness if determined appropriate in consultation with a physician.
Reports:
Immediate telephone reports to the health department.
Special Features:
The individual’s immunization history should be checked by the health care provider to determine if a “booster” dose for tetanus is required.
Administration of tetanus immune globulin (TIG) may be recommended by a health care provider for some individuals.
These are individuals who may have never initiated or completed the tetanus immunization series, or their tetanus immunization history is unknown.
See Immunization Schedule. http://www.immunize.org/cdc/schedules/ Bats
Any contact with bats, even if no bite is observed or reported, should be followed with a report to the local health department. Children should be taught to avoid any contact with bats as they are known to carry rabies in Idaho.
Recommendations for Preventing the Transmission of Salmonella from Reptiles to Humans
• Pet store owners, veterinarians, and pediatricians should provide information to owners and potential purchasers of reptiles about the risk for acquiring salmonellosis from reptiles.
• Persons should always wash their hands thoroughly with soap and water after handling reptiles or reptile cages.
• Persons at increased risk for infection or serious complications of salmonellosis (e.g. children aged less than 5 years and immunocompromised persons) should avoid contact with reptiles.
• Pet reptiles should be kept out of households where children less than 5 years or immunocompromised persons live. Families expecting a new child should remove the pet reptiles from the home before the infant arrives.
• Pet reptiles should not be allowed to roam freely throughout the home or living area.
• Pet reptiles should be kept out of kitchens and other food-preparation areas to prevent contamination. Kitchen sinks should not be used to bathe reptiles or to wash their dishes, cages, or aquariums. If bathtubs are used for these purposes, they should be cleaned thoroughly and disinfected with bleach.
• Pet reptiles should not be kept in child care centers. Hobo Spider Bites
Signs and Symptoms:
The bite from a hobo spider is relatively painless. It has been described as feeling like a pin prick if it is felt at all. If venom is injected, there may be numbing at the site of the bite. The area around the bite may become reddened and will eventually harden. A day or two after the bite, blistering may occur and after a few days a scab may form in the area.
 127

The time needed for complete healing of the area varies. It depends on the area of the bite, if venom is injected and how much, and other factors.
In addition to the tissue damage, other symptoms such as headaches, nausea, sweating, and joint pain maybe experienced after the bite.
Treatment:
If you believe a child in your care has been bitten by a hobo spider, be sure to point out to the parent or legal guardian. They may wish to seek medical attention.
Special Features:
Hobo spider bites are medically important because of their ability to cause tissue damage and illness. Males may have a more toxic bite than females and it is thought that immature spiders may cause the most serious bites. However, not all bites inject venom; some are "dry" bites and may only be a defensive bite for the spider to escape.
128

Complaints
The health districts have contracted with the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare to handle/investigate or refer to appropriate authority, all complaints on childcare facilities. All complaints are maintained in a file during and after the investigative period. Each health district has their own policies on confidentiality. Your health district will advise you if the complaint will remain confidential.
Investigation of Complaints:
A substantiated complaint is a complaint that has proven to be valid after the appropriate investigation is completed. Health district staff, child protection services, municipalities or the local police department, depending on the nature of the complaint, may conduct an investigation. All complaints investigated will be found to be substantiated or unsubstantiated and documented. Details of the complaint and complainant remain in the investigation file.
Complaint Records Review:
Anyone (including a childcare provider) requesting to review a complaint file (substantiated or unsubstantiated) must complete a public records request with the health district, local licensing agency or the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare. The request must comply with the Idaho Public Records Statute (Section 9-338 Idaho Code) and with the protocol of the involved agency.
Appeals:
Childcare providers have the option to appeal a substantiated complaint by submitting their appeal in writing to the Health District Director.

When checking your windows to see if they conform to the requirements for escape or rescue window, remember that twenty-four (24) inch height requirement and twenty (20) inch width requirements are minimum requirements. A window that is 24 inches in height and 20 inches in width does not qualify as an escape or rescue window because it will not have a minimum net clear opening area of 5.7 square feet.
• These minimum height and width requirements, plus the minimum opening area are necessary to allow firefighters with full protective clothing and air packs, to enter the building. The finished sill height of not more than 44 inches above the floor allows fire fighters to enter the building without falling a distance that would cause an injury.
• Are approved egress windows from sleeping areas operative from the inside without the use of separate tools?
129

• Where children are located on a story below the level of the exit discharge (basement), are there at least two exits provided, one of which is directly to the outside? More than one (1) exit to the outside may be required.
• When the children are located on a story above the level of exit discharge, there must be two (2) exits, one of which must open directly to the outside may be required and be in compliance with the building codes.
Exception: day care is permitted at the second floor level provided that the building is protected throughout by an automatic fire sprinkling system and has two exit doors directly from the second floor level to the outside.
Is the facility in compliance?
Fire Extinguisher Required
Is there at least one 2A-10BC fire extinguisher within seventy-five (75) feet travel distance to any portion of the home? It must be serviced and tagged annually. The distance from the top of the fire extinguisher to the floor cannot exceed five (5) feet.
Smoke Detector Required
A smoke detector is required on all floors, including the basement of the home. A smoke detector shall be located in the hall immediately outside any room used for sleeping purposes and in each room used for sleeping purposes. All of the detectors shall be audible in the sleeping room. If they are not, the detectors shall be inter-connected.
Additional Fire Code Recommendations
• The occupant load or required square footage per person is not an issue in the average home. s. The occupant load is determined by the local fire official or designee.
• All heating equipment and chimneys shall be maintained in a proper working condition (filters cleaned monthly and oil or gas furnaces services annually). At no time is an oil or gas unvented heater allowed.
• No wood stove or heater shall be installed that would block an exit if the unit malfunctions. Any heating producing equipment is recommended to have a guard to prevent burn injuries.
• Flammable liquid storage is not allowed within the home. Storage of up to ten (10) gallons is allowed in the garage.
• All electrical appliances, fixtures, panel boxes, receptacle outlets, switches and wiring shall be maintained in good condition. All circuits in the electrical panel shall be labeled. THE FIRE DEPARTMENT RECOMMENDS THAT ALL UNUSED ELECTRICAL OUTLETS BE PROVIDED WITH COVERS.
• The building will be free of excess accumulation of readily combustible materials such as paper, oily rags, and other waste on the interior and accumulation of dry weeds, leaves, etc., on the exterior.
• See IDAPA 16.06.02. Standards for Child Care Licensing for additional information concerning fire alarm requirements, fire safety evacuation plans and sprinkler system requirements.
