The following principles shall guide development and implementation of state policy to achieve that outcome:
(1) Family self-sufficiency. A stable source of child care is a critical ingredient to economic self-sufficiency. Child care policies and programs must facilitate a smooth transition into the work force for parents and a rich and stable environment for children.
(2) Investment in children. Child care is a critical investment that affects a child's readiness to learn. High quality child care programs recognize and implement good early childhood practices.
(3) Consumer orientation and education. Child care policies and programs must be responsive to the changing needs of families and educate families about available options, identifying quality programs and selecting appropriate care.
(4) Accessibility. High quality child care must be available to any family seeking care regardless of where the family lives or the special needs of the child. A centralized place in local communities must be available to facilitate parents' access to child care.
(5) Affordability. High quality child care must be available on a sliding scale basis, with families contributing based on ability to pay.
18

(6) Diversity. It is the goal of the state to strive wherever possible to provide child care in an integrated setting where children with various needs and of various income levels and cultures are cared for together.
(7) Efficient, coordinated administration and support for infrastructure. Child care programs must be coordinated to ensure the most effective use of federal, state, local and private funds. State child care agencies and policies must support the orderly development of a high quality child care system working with local and private providers.
(b) Any state agency involved in implementing any part of the state's child care policy shall develop appropriate measures of progress toward achievement of the stated
outcome under the oversight of the joint committee on children and families in accordance with K.S.A. 46-2001 et seq. and amendments thereto.

IF YOU HAVE DIAPERED CHILDREN IN YOUR CHILD CARE PROGRAM:
Always use this method for changing diapers. This is the best way to stop diseases that spread through the intestinal tract.
1. CHECK to make sure the supplies you need are ready.
o fresh diaper or clothes;
o freshly dampened paper towels or pre-moistened towelettes; and
o plastic bag for soiled diaper
2. PLACE roll paper or a disposable towel on the part of the diapering table where the child's bottom will be.
3. HOLD the child AWAY from your body when you pick him up. When you know a child has soiled his diaper use only your hands to carry him. LAY the child on the paper or towel.
4. REMOVE soiled diaper or clothes.
o Put disposable diapers in a plastic bag or a plastic lined receptacle.
o Put soiled clothes in a plastic bag for parents to take home with the child at the end of the day.
Tell the parents that washing or rinsing clothes soiled with stool at the day care center might cause disease germs to spread.
5. CLEAN the child's bottom with:
o a pre-moistened disposable towelette, or
o a damp paper towel.
Put the used towelette or paper towel in the plastic bag or plastic-lined receptacle.
6. REMOVE the paper or towel from beneath the child and dispose of it in the plastic bag or plastic-lined receptacle.
7. WIPE your hands with a pre-moistened disposable towelette or a damp paper towel and dispose of it in the plastic bag or plastic-lined receptacle. If you are wearing a glove, dispose of it now.
8. DIAPER or dress the child.
Now you can hold him close to you.
9. WASH the CHILD'S hands:
IMPORTANT: If you must walk from the diapering table to the sink
o be sure the child cannot fall, or
o carry him with you.
10. RETURN the child to his CRIB.
11. CLEAN and DISINFECT
o diapering area;
o equipment or supplies touched; and
o soiled crib or cot, if necessary.
12. WASH your hands.
