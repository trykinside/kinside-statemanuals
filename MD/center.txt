Purpose of the Manual
Introduction
 The Child Care Center Licensing Manual (Manual) is used as a reference for Office of Child Care (OCC) licensing staff, licensed child care center operators, and for those who apply to become child care center operators. The Manual primarily provides assistance in interpreting and applying Code of Maryland Regulation (COMAR) requirements when child care facilities are inspected for compliance by licensing staff. By providing a comprehensive set of interpretive guidelines, the Manual enables child care center operators to achieve and maintain compliance, and enables licensing staff to assess operator compliance in a consistent and equitable manner.
Contents and Use of the Manuals
The Manual is divided into chapters. Each chapter corresponds to the chapter number and subtitle of the related COMAR (Example –COMAR 13A.16 .01 Scope and Definitions). Each chapter is posted individually with its own table of contents listing the applicable subsections. Each chapter and subtitle includes the full text of the regulations found in each subsection of the chapter, the intent of the regulation, the inspection report item, the compliance criteria, the method by which compliance with the regulation is assessed, and reference notes, as applicable. The text of each regulation appears in bold type. The guidance information appears in italics. The referenced forms and resource documents appear in Red italics.
The Intent explains the regulation in more detail and the reason for the regulation.
The Inspection Report Item refers to the exact location on the Electronic Licensing Inspection System (ELIS) inspection form, or the paper Inspection Report where compliance or noncompliance with the regulation is recorded during an inspection.
The Compliance Criteria set forth the specific elements that OCC licensing staff will use in determining whether or not the inspection report item is in compliance.
The Assessment Method addresses the means by which licensing staff will evaluate the compliance criteria.
The Notes provide further details, explanations, or reference to resource materials and/or forms. Some of the “Notes” have been included only to give additional helpful information.
The referenced Forms and Resource Documents are easily accessed on the Licensing Branch website in the “Forms” and “Resource Documents” locations.

COMAR 13A.16.01 Scope and Definitions
 .01 Scope.
A. Applicability of Subtitle. Except as specified at §B of this regulation, this subtitle governs non-parental care of children for part of a 24-hour day not in the child's own home, in a group setting such as a child care center, preschool, child development center, nursery school, before-school and after-school program, school age child care, or early learning center, by whatever name known, under private nonprofit, proprietary, public, and religious auspices.
INTENT: When a parent or guardian enrolls in a child care facility, there may be certain risks for the child. To offset these risks, child care center regulations have been established to protect the child’s health and safety. These regulations set certain minimum standards for child health and safety and the operation of a child care program.
B. Exemptions. This subtitle does not apply to:
(1) A family child care home registered under COMAR 13A.15;
(2) A facility that offers or provides a residential placement for a child under
Family Law Article, Title 5, Subtitle 5, or Health-General Article, Title 6 or 10,
Annotated Code of Maryland;
(3) A youth camp, as defined by Health-General Article, §14-401(j), Annotated
Code of Maryland;
(4) A child care service operated by the federal government or on federal property;
(5) A public school during the hours in which an instructional program is offered;
(6) A nonpublic kindergarten for children at least 5 years old during the hours in
which an instructional program is offered;
(7) A nonpublic elementary school during the hours in which an instructional
program is offered;
(8) Child care services provided in connection with a shelter housing individuals
temporarily without residences, exclusively for the children of those individuals;
(9) The physical plant, including sanitary facilities, of a child care center exclusively
for school age children, located in a currently operating public or nonpublic school building, if the application of the regulation would require modification of the physical plant;
(10) Programs that operate for 6 weeks or less in any calendar year; or
(11) The instructional program, curriculum, and teacher, principal, and
administrator qualifications of a:
(a) Nursery school operated by a tax-exempt religious organization which does
not have a certificate of approval from the State Board of Education; or
(b) Child care program operated by a tax-exempt religious organization in a
school building used exclusively for children who are enrolled in that school.
INTENT: Certain early childhood programs and services are exempt from the requirements of COMAR 13A.16 – Child Care Centers, because:
COMAR 13A.16.01 Scope and Definitions August 29, 2016
Page 1 of 12

COMAR 13A.16.01 Scope and Definitions
  They do not meet the definition of a child care center;
 They are granted licensing exemption under Maryland law; or
 Their period of operation is too short to allow the application of licensing
requirements.
Exemption Categories include:
 Unconditionally Exempt. The following are exempt from the requirement to be licensed because they are outside the scope of licensing regulations:
 Child care provided in connection with a shelter (for homeless persons, battered women, etc.) as long as the service are exclusively for children of persons residing in the shelter. The child care service need not be provided in the shelter facility itself, but may be provided in an adjacent building.
 Summer Youth Camps licensed by Maryland State Department of Health and Mental Hygiene.
 A nonpublic nursery school operated by a bona fide tax-exempt religious organization as long as the nursery school holds a certificate of approval from the Maryland State Department of Education.
 Child care service provided on federal government property.
 A program for children that is operated for six weeks or less in a calendar
year.
 An instructional program for three-year old or four-year-old children
offered by a non-public or public school during school hours.
 Sunday schools (no matter when actually held) or Bible schools.
 Exempt by Definition. The following are exempt from the requirement to be licensed because they are not considered “child care” as defined under COMAR 13A.16.01.02B (14) (b). These programs include:
 Before school or after school activity conducted or sponsored by a public or nonpublic school that is approved or exempt from approval by the Maryland State Department of Education.
 Group lessons or classes, unless provided in a pattern indicating that a child care center is being operated. “Lessons or classes” mean specialized training in a specific subject such as swimming, tennis, sports clinics, computers, foreign languages, dance, gymnastics, arts and crafts, and music.
 Scouting, sports, or youth club activities. A "youth club" means an organization where participants come together for a common purpose in
COMAR 13A.16.01 Scope and Definitions August 29, 2016
  Page 2 of 12

COMAR 13A.16.01 Scope and Definitions
 which there may be a membership fee. Examples include hobby clubs, photography clubs, drama clubs, service clubs, etc.
 School-age recreational or supplementary education programs operated by local Departments of Recreation and Parks or by public or nonpublic schools, as long as custodial supervision is not the primary purpose of the program. Some Departments of Recreation and Parks offer latch-key child care services. The services do not differ in substance from after-school child care and must be licensed.
 Preschool programs offered by Departments of Recreation and Parks that mirror traditional nursery schools must be licensed. However, a preschool program that lasts for approximately 1 hour per day, 1 or more times per week, which consists of skills instruction (such as gymnastics, dance, tumbling, art, etc.) does not need to be licensed.
 Before-and-after-school programs for school age children operated by tax-exempt religious organizations that are located in schools and serve only children who are enrolled in those schools.
 Supervisory services to children while parents are immediately available. A program does not need to be licensed if it provides child supervision in support of occasional or intermittent parental activities by sponsors such as health spas, aerobics classes, doctor's offices, supermarkets, etc., where the parents are on-site, can be notified immediately by the sponsor in the event of emergency, and can return to the child.
 Partial Exemptions – Staff Qualifications, Curriculum, Certain Equipment. Pursuant to COMAR 13A.16.02.01B, certain facilities are exempt from requirements pertaining to staff qualification, program curriculum, and certain equipment. These programs include:
 Nursery schools or child care centers operated by tax-exempt religious organizations, and
 Approved Montessori Schools
 Partial Exemption – Physical Plant. Child care centers for school-age children operated before and after school in a building that is currently in use as a public or private school are exempt from any licensing regulation that would require modification of the physical plant; however, such child care programs are subject to local fire, health, and zoning codes required of school buildings.

.02 Definitions.
COMAR 13A.16.01 Scope and Definitions
 NOTE: Particularly with respect to businesses or organizations that offer after-school programs, it is sometimes difficult to determine if child care is being provided, or whether an organized "lesson" or "class" is truly the primary focus of the program. As applicable, the following questions should be asked to help make this determination:
 What time do children arrive for the after-school program?
 Does the program provide transportation to the after-school site? If so,
beginning at what time are the children picked up? At what time do they arrive at the after-school site? At what time are lessons offered and for how long? When do the children leave? Who transports them when they depart the after-school site? Does the program serve children who do not participate in the after-school program?
 Are there any children who are at the after-school program all day? If so, at what times are lessons offered to those children? What activities are the children involved in when they are not taking lessons?
 Is the after-school program open to children on school holidays? If so, how long are children at the program site when they are not actually participating in a specific lesson or class? What are they doing when they are not in class, and who supervises them?
 Are field trips offered? If so, how often and what do they consist of? How long is their duration? Who supervises the children during the field trips?
 What services does the program offer in its advertising? If the program has any advertising flyers or brochures, request that the program director provide copies for review. If the program has a website, get the address.
 Does the program hold a camp license pursuant to Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene regulations governing youth camps?

COMAR 13A.16.02 License Application and Maintenance
 .01 License—General Requirements.
A. Requirement to be Licensed. A person, organization, agency, corporation, or other
entity which operates a child care center, as defined in this chapter, is required to be licensed or to hold a letter of compliance in accordance with this subtitle or with COMAR 13A.17, as applicable.
INTENT: Maryland law requires a child care center, as defined in COMAR 13A.16.01.02 B (14), to be licensed before it may operate. Licensure indicates that a facility has met minimum child health and safety standards. By setting certain requirements for the care, supervision, and nurturance of children in out-of-home care, the standards serve to protect the well-being of those children. As a condition of licensure, each operator must comply with all applicable requirements of COMAR 13A.16 Child Care Centers. Failure to comply may result in denial, suspension, or revocation of the license.
Note: Operating a child care center without a valid license is a violation of Maryland law and may result in criminal prosecution.
B. Nursery School or Child Care Center Operated by a Tax-Exempt Religious Organization.
(1) Except as provided by §B (2) or (3), as applicable, of this regulation, a tax- exempt religious organization that wishes to operate a nursery school or a child care center shall apply to become licensed, and shall meet all applicable requirements, under this subtitle.
(2) If the tax-exempt religious organization plans to operate a nursery school or a child care center in a school building that exclusively serves children who are enrolled in that school, the organization may apply for a:
(a) Child care center license under this subtitle; or
(b) Letter of compliance under COMAR 13A.17.
(3) In a nursery school or child care center located in a school building exclusively
for children enrolled in that school and operated by a tax-exempt religious organization, the following regulations of this subtitle do not apply:
(a) COMAR 13A.16.03.05C (1) and (2) concerning staff records;
(b) COMAR 13A.16.06.05—.12 concerning professional qualifications and
training requirements for child care staff and the director, principal, or
administrator of the program; and
(c) COMAR 13A.16.09.01, .03B (1) and (2), and .03C concerning the program.
INTENT: Education Article, § 9.5-405(b), Annotated Code of Maryland, exempts tax-exempt religious organizations from licensing requirements pertaining to qualifications for program administrators and staff and to program curriculum content or structure in a nursery school or a child care center in a school building exclusively for children enrolled in that school. These areas are
COMAR 13A.16.02 License Application and Maintenance August 29, 2016
 Page 1 of 16

COMAR 13A.16.02 License Application and Maintenance
 not subject to review by the Office of Child Care. While staff records must be kept, however, they need not include information about staff age, position, or qualifications. If a tax-exempt religious organization seeks nursery school approval only, a child care center license is not required.
Note: The tax-exempt religious organization must obtain an exemption letter from the Maryland State Department of Education (MSDE), Nonpublic School Approval Branch, if seeking exemption from approval to operate a nonpublic school, and maintain such letter on file at the school.
C. Approved Montessori School.
(1) Except as set forth at §C(2) of this regulation, an approved Montessori school
shall meet all applicable requirements of this subtitle regarding:
(a) Child health and safety;
(b) The provision of child care; and
(c) An educational program in a nonpublic nursery school.
(2) The following regulations under this subtitle do not apply to an approved Montessori school:
(a) COMAR 13A.16.02.03(4) concerning an annual fire inspection, if the school
has documentation verifying compliance with fire safety regulations applicable to a nonpublic nursery school pursuant to COMAR 13A.09.09.11A;
(b) COMAR 13A.16.06.05.B(4) concerning the preservice training requirement for directors;
(c) COMAR 13A.16.06.09.A(1)(b) concerning qualification requirements for a child care teacher in a preschool center;
(d) COMAR 13A.16.06.09.B(1)(a) concerning the core of knowledge completion requirement for continued training;
(e) COMAR 13A.16.06.10.B(1)(a) concerning the requirement for preservice training; and
(f) COMAR 13A.16.09.01A (4) concerning the requirements for a balanced schedule of daily activities.
INTENT: A Montessori school must be certified by a Department-recognized Montessori validating organization that considers, at a minimum, the elements of teacher qualifications, written curriculum, instructional methods, and materials.
Note: The term “Montessori” cannot be used in the school’s name unless the school is certified as required at COMAR 13A.16.16.03C.
D. A license is nontransferable and remains the property of the office.

COMAR 13A.16.02 License Application and Maintenance
  A license may be issued only to a specific applicant for operation of a child care center at a specific location. Any change in the applicant or the location requires issuance of a new license.
 Once a license is issued, it confers a certain property right that cannot be taken away by the State without due process of law. The license document, however, is State property and must be returned to the State if the center’s authority to operate is suspended or terminated, or if the center goes out of business.
Note: When the ownership of a facility is transferred, it is important to maintain the continuity of care as much as possible in order to minimize disruption in the child care services provided by the previous ownership. For guidance on ensuring that continuity of care is maintained, see "Change of Licensee/Letter Holder".
E. The operator shall post the license at a location in the center where it can easily be seen and read whenever parents or others visit the center.
INTENT: The center’s license must be plainly displayed so that parents and visitors can easily determine if the facility is authorized to operate a child care program and, if so, the conditions under which that authorization has been granted (i.e., days and hours of operation, maximum capacity, etc.).
INSPECTION REPORT ITEM: “License Conspicuously Displayed” COMPLIANCE CRITERIA: The license is posted in the child care area in a manner
that allows it to be seen plainly and easily by parents or other visitors to the center.
ASSESSMENT METHOD: Observe the location and visibility of the license.
F. The operator shall surrender the license to the office immediately if any of the following occurs or becomes effective:
(1) The operator closes the center permanently;
(2) The license is revoked;
(3) The license is suspended; or
(4) The license expires, and the:
(a) Application for a continuing license is denied; or
(b) Operator has not applied for a continuing license.
G. A center approved by the office before July 1, 2008, for the concurrent operation of
more than one type of child care program may continue to be used to operate those programs, except that, while concurrent approvals are in effect, the office may not approve a request by the operator for:
(1) An increase in child capacity;
(2) A change in the hours of operation;
(3) A change in the ages of children served;
COMAR 13A.16.02 License Application and Maintenance August 29, 2016

INTENT: On January 1, 2012, the licensing category “Small Center” was abolished by Statute and replaced with the registration category “Large Family Child Care Homes”. Providers who did not want to convert their Small Center licensing status to a Large Family Child Care Home registration status were allowed to remain as Small Centers.
.02 Initial License.
A. An individual or organization not currently licensed and wanting to operate a child
care center shall:
(1) Complete an orientation to child care center licensing regulations that is offered
or approved by the office;

(2) File a notice of intent with the office before applying for permits in connection with construction or operation of a center;
INTENT: The notice of intent alerts the Regional Office that a new child care facility is being planned. This enables the Regional Office to open a new license application file and to begin arranging any technical assistance the applicant may need.
Note: A pre-site visit must be conducted to assess feasibility of proposed site. Size, layout, and outdoor space are major considerations. Continue the provision of technical assistance throughout the process to ensure that development activities meet regulatory requirements.
(3) Submit to the office at least 60 days before the proposed opening date a completed and signed application form, supplied by the office, that contains a statement of truthfulness and commitment to comply with this subtitle; and

 Page 7 of 16

COMAR 13A.16.02 License Application and Maintenance
 Note: At least 120 days before current license expiration, the Regional Office will transmit to the operator a "Request for Continuing Status" application packet.

initial or a continuing license additional time to meet all applicable requirements, the Office may approve an initial or a continuing license on a provisional basis for a period of up to 120 days after determining that the health and safety of the children in care are not in imminent danger.
(2) An initial license may not be approved if the Office has not yet received evidence that the applicant and each individual, as applicable, specified at Regulation .02A(4) and B(1) of this chapter has successfully passed a federal and State criminal background check and a review of child and adult abuse and neglect records.
COMAR 13A.16.02 License Application and Maintenance August 29, 2016
  Page 10 of 16

COMAR 13A.16.02 License Application and Maintenance
 (3) At the end of the provisional period, if all requirements for the initial or continuing license are not met due to:
(a) Failure by the applicant to take an action necessary to achieve compliance,
the Office shall deny the application for license; or
(b) Circumstances beyond the control of the applicant, the Office may continue
the provisional status for one or more additional periods of up to 120 days per period, except that provisional status may not be continued for more than 24 months after the start of the first provisional period.
(4) If the Office denies a license at the end of the provisional period, the applicant or operator does not have a valid license and shall cease operating.
INTENT: A license on a provisional status permits the facility to operate on a temporary basis even though certain necessary requirements have not yet been fully met. It grants a specified amount of time to meet those requirements. A license may be issued with a provisional status only if the unmet requirements do not represent a potential threat to the health, safety, or welfare of children in care.
Note: When removing an applicant from provisional status to licensure, be sure to include the provisional time period(s) in the two-year expiration/anniversary date. For example:
Provisional was issued on February 22, 2010 for 120 days. Another provisional was issued on June 22, 2010 for another 60 days ending August 21, 2010. Provider came into compliance on August 21, 2010. You would issue the License, LOC, or Registration with the start date of August 22, 2010 and calculate the expiration/anniversary date by using the 1st provisional dated February 22, 2010 which would result in an expiration/anniversary date of January 31, 2012.
B. ConditionalStatus.
(1) If an operator who holds a continuing license fails to remedy a violation as
required, the Office may place the license on conditional status for:
(a) A period of up to 120 days; and
(b) Upon approval by the Agency's central office, an additional period of up to
120 days.
(2) Upon placing a continuing license on conditional status, the Office shall issue to
the operator a revised license that states the:
(a) Placement of the license on conditional status;
(b) Period of time of the conditional status; and
(c) Requirements for lifting the conditional status.
(3) Immediately upon receipt of the revised license, the operator shall:
(a) Remove from display in the center the continuing license that was originally
issued; and
(b) Display the revised license as required by Regulation .01D of this chapter.
COMAR 13A.16.02 License Application and Maintenance August 29, 2016
 Page 11 of 16

COMAR 13A.16.02 License Application and Maintenance
 (4) If the operator satisfies all requirements for lifting the conditional status within the specified period of time, the Office shall promptly:
(a) Discontinue the conditional status; and
(b) Notify the operator to redisplay the original continuing license.
(5) If the operator fails to satisfy all requirements for lifting the conditional status within the specified period of time, the Office may suspend or revoke the continuing license.
INTENT: After a continuing license is issued, if an operator fails to correct certain noncompliance, OCC may replace the continuing license with a revised license placing it on conditional status. Conditional status is issued for a specified period of time and sets forth specific requirements for reinstatement of the continuing license. If the operator has still failed to make the necessary corrections by the end of the specified timeframe, the continuing license may be suspended or revoked.
INSPECTION REPORT ITEM: “Conditional Status”
COMPLIANCE CRITERIA: The conditional license is posted in the child care area in a manner that can be easily seen by parents and other individuals visiting the center.
ASSESSMENT METHODS:
 Observe to see if the conditional license is posted.
 Observe the location of the conditional license to determine if it is visible to parents and other individuals visiting the center.
Note: A Continuing License is placed on “Conditional” status as a last resort to encourage the Provider to come into compliance with regulations. Placing a provider’s continuing license on conditional status is optional. Using the progressive discipline process, i.e., warning letters, compliance agreements, and intermediate sanctions, continue to be viable disciplinary options. If these instruments fail, moving on to suspension, emergency suspension, and revocation is appropriate without ever having placed a continuing license on conditional status.
.05 Response of the Office to Application.
A. Upon receiving a completed application, whether for an initial license or a continuing license, and all documentation required by law or regulation, the office shall determine compliance with the requirements of this chapter by:
(1) Evaluating the application and required documentation; and
(2) Inspecting the:
(a) Facility proposed for use as a child care center, if the application is for an initial license; or
COMAR 13A.16.02 License Application and Maintenance August 29, 2016
 Page 12 of 16

COMAR 13A.16.02 License Application and Maintenance
 Note: When an applicant is ready for an “Initial Inspection”, the majority of the application requirements should have been met (U&O, Fire, CBCs, Releases, Medicals, Provider Requirements, and Staff Requirements, etc.) leaving only the physical plant, certain program requirements, and certain health and safety requirements to check during the “Initial Inspection”. For special instructions, see “Conducting ‘Initial’ Inspections”.
(b) Child care center, if the application is for a continuing license.
INTENT: Once a complete Initial or Continuing License application has been submitted, the Regional Office must assess it in its entirety to ensure that all pertinent application requirements have been met. Before an application can be approved, the facility must also be inspected to ensure that all applicable facility requirements have been met. The Regional Office has an obligation to the applicant to complete its review of the application and conduct the required inspection in an expeditious manner.
B. Except as specified at §C of this regulation, the office shall, within 30 days after completing the procedures in §A of this regulation:
(1) For an initial license application:
(a) Issue an initial license;
(b) Issue an initial license with provisional status; or
(c) Deny an initial license; or
(2) For a continuing license application, issue or deny a continuing license.
INTENT: Once the complete application has been evaluated and the facility itself has been found to be in compliance with all applicable requirements, The Regional Office has an obligation to approve or deny the license in an expeditious manner.
C. The office may not issue an initial license until child care staff, sufficient in number to meet the staff/child ratio and group size requirements of COMAR 13A.16.08.03 as they apply to the requested child capacity, have successfully passed federal and State criminal background checks and a review of child and adult abuse and neglect records.
.06 Denial of License.
A. An office may deny an application for an initial license or a continuing license if: (1) The applicant or the building in which child care is provided fails to meet the
requirements of this chapter;
(2) An evaluation of the application form by the office reveals that the applicant
reported false information;
(3) The applicant has a history of regulatory violations which demonstrates an
inability to provide for the health or safety of children;
COMAR 13A.16.02 License Application and Maintenance August 29, 2016
 Page 13 of 16

COMAR 13A.16.02 License Application and Maintenance
 (4) The applicant has previously had a family day care registration, child care center license, or letter of compliance denied or revoked by the office, unless the office is satisfied that the condition that was the basis for the denial or revocation has been corrected;
(5) The applicant prevents the office from completing its responsibilities for licensing;
(6) An evaluation of criminal records or records of abuse or neglect of children and adults indicates, for those identified in Regulation .02A(4) and .02B(1) of this chapter, behavior harmful to children; or
(7) The office concludes that the applicant cannot provide for the health, safety, or welfare of the children in care on the basis of:
(a) Substantial, credible evidence of the applicant's abuse of alcohol or
controlled dangerous substances, mental instability, or other condition; or
(b) Other pertinent information received by the office which creates reasonable
doubt as to the applicant's ability to provide child care in accordance with this subtitle.
INTENT: As specified by Maryland law, the primary purpose of center licensing regulations is to protect the health, safety, and well-being of each child in care. For this reason, OCC may disapprove a license application if the applicant falsifies information submitted in connection with the application or has demonstrated an inability to maintain satisfactory compliance with licensing regulations, or if OCC has substantial reason to believe that the applicant, the physical condition of the facility, or a person connected with the facility may present a risk of harm to a child in care.
Notes:
 Reporting false Information: This includes falsification of any required documentation. As a basis for denial, this is generally used in combination with another basis, such as an unreported criminal history, a history of licensing violations, or a child abuse history.
 Previous regulatory history: The applicant previously held a license, certificate, or other permission to operate a program or facility serving children, and the applicant’s compliance history as an operator shows an inability to provide for the health or safety of children.
 Refusal to comply: Examples include refusal to complete a required orientation session, submit required application documents, allow an inspection of the facility, apply for criminal background checks, or abide by the requirements of a compliance agreement.
COMAR 13A.16.02 License Application and Maintenance August 29, 2016
    Page 14 of 16

COMAR 13A.16.02 License Application and Maintenance
  Previous denial or revocation: Generally, if a child care license or letter of compliance previously held by the applicant was denied or revoked due to gross or repeated overcapacity, serious lack of supervision, repeated failure to meet staff/child ratio and/or group size requirements, child neglect or abuse, or illegal activity involving the facility, the Office of Child Care will not approve another license or letter of compliance.
 Criminal history: The applicant’s criminal background check report (State or FBI) reveals a conviction, pending charge, probation before judgment, or not criminally responsible disposition for certain acts or attempted acts, which include but are not limited to the following:
 A crime involving:  A child;
 Cruelty to animals;
 Domestic violence; or
 A weapons or firearms violation of federal or state laws;
 A sex offense;
 A violent crime classified as a felony;
 Abduction or kidnapping;
 Abuse of a child or an adult;
 Confinement of an unattended child;
 Manufacturing, distributing, or dispensing a controlled dangerous substance;
 Perjury;
 Pornography;
 Possession with intent to manufacture, distribute, or dispense a controlled
dangerous substance; or
 Reckless endangerment.
 Child abuse and neglect: The Regional Office carefully evaluates each report of indicated abuse or neglect to determine:
 The seriousness of the abuse or neglect,
 How long ago the abuse or neglect occurred,
 Whether it indicates a current potential risk to children in care, and
 Whether the offender has undergone any rehabilitation.
 The presence, by itself, of an abuse or neglect finding does not automatically
disqualify the applicant from being approved for a child care license.
Note:
See chapter 06, regulation .03, Suitability for Employment, for additional information regarding disqualification based on criminal history or child abuse/neglect background checks.
COMAR 13A.16.02 License Application and Maintenance August 29, 2016

COMAR 13A.16.02 License Application and Maintenance
 B. If the office denies an application, the office shall notify the applicant in writing by certified mail of the denial, stating the:
(1) Reason for denial;
(2) Specific regulation with which the applicant has failed to comply that is the basis
for the denial;
(3) Applicant's right to request a hearing; and
(4) Procedure to be used if the applicant wishes to request a hearing to appeal the
decision of the office.
INTENT: Under Maryland law, OCC must comply with due process requirements if an application is denied. This means that OCC must inform the applicant why the decision to deny was made, the applicant’s appeal rights, and how those rights may be exercised.
Notes:
 See the “Request for Hearing/Appeal” form, OCC 1281.
 See chapter 18, Administrative Hearings, for requirements pertaining to the appeal hearing process under the Office of Administrative Hearings (OAH).
C. Denial Before Complete Application.
(1) The office may deny an application for an initial or a continuing license at any
point during the application process if, following evaluation of information received to that point, the office determines that a basis for denial exists as set forth in §A of this regulation.
(2) If the office decides to deny the application before the application process is complete, the office shall send written notice of that decision to the applicant within 30 calendar days after making the decision.
INTENT: To spare the applicant unnecessary additional expense or effort, if the office concludes during the application process that the application cannot be approved, the office will terminate the process and advise the applicant accordingly.

 .01 Multi-Site Centers.
A child care center may have more than one location and may be treated as one center for purposes of this chapter only if:
A. The buildings:
(1) Function as one integrated center, are in close proximity such as across the street
or on the same campus, and are connected by an intercom system; and
(2) Are under the supervision of one director; and
B. Two or more locations:
(1) Are administered by one central administration with one ownership; and
(2) Share common administrative policies and procedures and contracts.
INTENT: When a child care license is issued, it is issued to authorize operation only at a specific location. A licensee may be authorized to operate a number of centers at various locations, but each of these centers must be separately licensed because each is sited at a different location. Most centers are fully contained within a single area or structure; however, a center’s “location” may include two or more separate areas or structures if those areas or structures are in close physical proximity to each other and are operated as a single administrative unit under a single director.
INSPECTION REPORT ITEM: “Multi-Site Centers”
COMPLIANCE CRITERIA: Each different site location or location address of a center has been issued a separate license; however, if the licensee has been authorized to operate two or more separate structures in close physical proximity to each other as a single “location”, only one license is required.
ASSESSMENT METHOD: Review the address locations of the center operations to determine:
 If the multi-site center operates at different location addresses and holds a separate license for each site location.
 Verify if the licensee has been authorized to operate separate areas or structures of the center as a single “location” and holds a single license for such an operation.
.02 Admission to Care.
A. An operator may not admit a child for care unless the operator has:
(1) Met the applicable requirements of this regulation; and
(2) Received the written records required by Regulation .04C—H of this chapter,
unless the child is temporarily admitted or retained in care on a temporary basis pursuant to §F of this regulation.
COMAR 13A.16.03 Management and Administration
August 29, 2016
Page 1 of 32

COMAR 13A.16.03 Management and Administration
 INTENT: A child may not begin care until the center has received a medical evaluation, immunization certificate (immunization record), and emergency information for the child.
INSPECTION REPORT ITEM: “Admission to Care” COMPLIANCE CRITERIA:
 On or before the first day that the child begins care, the center has received the following items signed by the child’s parent or guardian and, if indicated, by a licensed health practitioner:
 “Emergency Form”, OCC form 1214
 “Health Inventory”, OCC form 1215 (or equivalent form which
contains all information as required on the Health Inventory)
 “Immunization Certificate” (record), DHMH form 896
ASSESSMENT METHOD: Review of children’s files to determine if the child’s file contains a completed Emergency Form, Health Inventory, and Immunization Certificate (immunization record).
Notes:
 When documents required for admission to care have not been received, inform the operator or Director that the parent must be told that the child may not return to the center until all required documents are received. Do not send the child home.
 While verification of “Lead Screening” is a part of the Health Inventory, the parent has 30 days after admission to get it completed.
 See the current DHMH “Age-Appropriate Immunization Chart” schedule.
Federal law under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) prohibits child care programs from denying admission to a child with a disability solely on the basis of that disability. For more information on the applicability of ADA requirements to child care programs, see “Child Care and the A.D.A.”
B. At or before the child's admission to care, the operator shall obtain written information from the parent about the child's individual needs.
INTENT: Before caring for a child, center staff must know the individual needs of a child. In order for this information to be specific to each child, the information about each child must be provided in writing by the parent. This information must be maintained by the center for the purpose of easy reference by center staff.

COMPLIANCE CRITERIA: There is a written statement from the parent about each child’s individual needs that is maintained by the center. Documentation indicates that center personnel and the child’s parent have discussed any particular needs the child may have so that the program can be prepared to address those needs. This discussion must occur on or before the first day that child begins in care.
Note: Documentation may be in any format, but it must include, at a minimum:
 The date of the discussion;
 The specific nature of the child’s individual needs, if any, identified by the
parent; and,
 The signatures of the parent and the center representative.

Page 3 of 32

COMAR 13A.16.03 Management and Administration
  Interview the operator about if and how information has been provided to parents about how to receive a copy of the information brochure.
D. Upon admission of an infant or toddler, an operator shall determine with the parent:
(1) A schedule for feeding the child that includes:
(a) The amounts and kinds of food consumed daily;
(b) The sequence for introducing solid food when appropriate; and
(c) Any recommendations about feeding from the infant's physician;
INTENT: At the time of admission of a child under age 2, the operator must establish a written feeding regimen for the child in consultation with the parent. The regimen must include feeding times, types and amounts of food, and food progression and must address any medical recommendations regarding feeding. The established regimen must be followed, and it must be re-evaluated at least every 3 months or more often as necessary.

COMPLIANCE CRITERIA: For each child under 2-years-old, a written feeding
regimen:
 Is established at the child's admission in consultation with the parent;
 Addresses all the required elements;
 Is implemented during each day that the child is in attendance; and
 Is re-evaluated in consultation with the parent at least every 3 months or more often as necessary.
ASSESSMENT METHOD: Review the file of each child in care who is under 2-years- old to determine if a written feeding regimen is present that meets all listed compliance criteria.
(2) A written individual activity plan for the child; and
INTENT: When an infant or toddler is enrolled in care, the operator must ensure that a written individualized activity plan for the child is developed jointly by the child's parent and a qualified staff member.

COMAR 13A.16.03 Management and Administration
August 29, 2016
Page 4 of 32

COMAR 13A.16.03 Management and Administration
 COMPLIANCE CRITERIA:
 For each infant and toddler enrolled in care, there is a written individualized activity plan that was jointly developed by qualified staff and the parent at the time of the child's admission to care.
 The written plan details:
 The child's normal eating, sleeping, and other activity patterns and
specifies how the facility will accommodate those patterns;
 How the child will receive consistent and appropriate stimulation;
 Diapering; and
 Assignment per shift of a qualified primary caregiver.
ASSESSMENT METHOD: Review each enrolled infant and toddler’s record to determine if a written plan is present and if the plan meets the compliance criteria.
(3) If the child is a toddler or an infant who is 12 months old or older, the need for the child to use a crib for rest purposes.
INTENT: If a parent of a child who is 12 months old or older knows their child needs a crib for rest time, the parent must inform the center of such.
INSPECTION REPORT ITEM: “Admission to Care”
COMPLIANCE CRITERIA: There is a crib available for use by each infant and/or toddler enrolled who is 12 months old or older whose parent has informed the center that the child needs to sleep/rest in a crib.
ASSESSMENT METHOD: Determine if any parent of a child who is 12 months old or older has informed the center that their child needs a crib for sleeping/resting. If so, observe to see if a crib (or cribs) is/are available for such a child/ren.
E. If a child is younger than 6 years old at the time of admission, the operator may not allow the child to remain in care if the parent does not, within 30 days after the child's admission, submit evidence to the operator on a form supplied or approved by the Office that the child has received an appropriate lead screening in accordance with applicable State or local requirements.
INTENT: To help decrease the damaging effects of lead poisoning in children, Maryland law requires each child under the age of 6 years to have an appropriate lead screening within 30 days after beginning in care at the center.
INSPECTION REPORT ITEM: “Admission to Care”
COMAR 13A.16.03 Management and Administration
August 29, 2016
Page 5 of 32

COMAR 13A.16.03 Management and Administration
 COMPLIANCE CRITERIA: Within 30 days after admitting a child younger than 6 years old, the center received a completed and signed “Health Inventory”, OCC form 1215 or equivalent form approved by the Regional Office.
ASSESSMENT METHOD: Review children’s files to determine if and when the center received the required documentation.
Notes:
 The child’s parent is responsible for making sure the child has received a lead screening.
 The child’s physician is responsible for ensuring that the child received the appropriate lead screening.
 If a child has been tested but the health practitioner does not have the test date, the local health department in the jurisdiction where the child lives can help the child’s parent get a record of the test results.
 The zip codes of the at-risk areas that require blood lead testing are listed on the back of the Health Inventory form. When a child registers to begin school, this form will meet the requirements for school entry. For this reason, parents should be encouraged to keep a copy of the form for school registration purposes.
 The center operator is responsible for making sure the center receives documentation of the appropriate lead screening within 30 days after the child first attends care. If that documentation is not received within the required timeframe (or if the documentation shows that the screening was not the correct one as required by State or local law), the operator may not permit the child to attend the center until the parent supplies documentation that the child has had the appropriate lead screening.
F. Temporary Admission to Care.
(1) An operator may temporarily admit or retain a child in care if:
(a) The child is homeless; or
(b) The child’s parent is unable to provide the health-related records specified in
Regulation .04D, E, G, or H of this chapter.
(2) For a child to be temporarily admitted or retained in care, the parent shall
present evidence of the child’s appointment with a health care provider or local health department to:
(a) Receive a medical evaluation to include, if applicable, a lead screening;
(b) Receive a required immunization;
COMAR 13A.16.03 Management and Administration
 August 29, 2016
Page 6 of 32

COMAR 13A.16.03 Management and Administration
 (c) Acquire evidence of age-appropriate immunizations on a form approved by the office; or
(d) Reconstruct a lost health record.
(3) The date of the appointment required by §F (2) of this regulation may not be
later than 20 calendar days after the date the child was temporarily admitted or
retained.
(4) An operator shall exclude from care a child who has been temporarily admitted
or retained in care if the parent fails to provide evidence of the required health- related information within 3 business days after the date of the appointment made pursuant to §F(2) of this regulation.
.03 Program Records. The operator shall:
A. Create and maintain, for at least 2 years after their creation, records of program:
(1) Enrollment, with each child's name, address, telephone number, date of birth,
and dates and time periods for which enrolled; and
(2) Attendance, by groups of children, which indicate:
(a) The dates of attendance of each child in the center; and
(b) Verification by each child's parent of that child's recorded daily attendance
in care; and
INTENT: The facility must maintain enrollment and attendance records for all children enrolled to enable OCC to assess compliance with regulatory requirements pertinent to facility capacity, staff/child ratios, and group size. Parental verification of attendance provides proof that the child was in attendance on any particular day.
INSPECTION REPORT ITEMS: “Program Records”
COMPLIANCE CRITERIA: The center maintains current and complete
enrollment and attendance records.
ASSESSMENT METHOD: Review the facility’s files to determine if the required records are present and that the operator has a process in place for parental verification of attendance.
Note: Parental verification of attendance was mandated for purposes related to programs with children participating in the Subsidy program. Operators must submit attendance verification with their invoices for payment. Operators may develop various processes for parent verification which are acceptable.
COMAR 13A.16.03 Management and Administration
 August 29, 2016
Page 7 of 32

COMAR 13A.16.03 Management and Administration
 B. Maintain:
(1) Procedures to ensure that the whereabouts of each child in attendance is known
at all times;
INTENT: The operator must ensure that facility staff know where each child is at all times while the child is in attendance.
INSPECTION REPORT ITEM: "Program Records"
COMPLIANCE CRITERIA: The center has a procedure to ensure that staff members
always know the location of each child.
ASSESSMENT METHOD:
 Ask the Director if the required procedure exists and whether it is written or verbal. If it is written, ask to see it.
 Interview facility staff to evaluate their knowledge of the procedure.
(2) A written child discipline policy as required in COMAR 13A.16.07.03C;
INTENT: Providers and staff are more likely to avoid abusive practices if they are well-informed about effective, non-abusive methods for managing children’s behaviors. The center must keep on file the written discipline policy required by Regulation .07.03C.
INSPECTION REPORT ITEM: "Program Records"
COMPLIANCE CRITERIA: The written discipline procedures are maintained on
file.
ASSESSMENT METHOD: If the written procedures are not openly posted, ask a facility staff member where a copy can be found.
Note: See sample policy guide, entitled “Discipline Measures”.
(3) Records of food actually served by the center for the most recent 4 weeks as
required by COMAR 13A.16.12.01G;
INTENT: Proper menu planning is critical to ensuring that children in care get nutritionally correct types and amounts of food and beverages each day. Parents have a right to know what food is being served to their children and when, and menu- posting provides them with this knowledge. For the same reason, and because last- minute changes to planned menus are sometimes necessary, a record of food actually served must be kept for a reasonable period of time.

COMAR 13A.16.03 Management and Administration INSPECTION REPORT ITEM: "Program Records"
COMPLIANCE CRITERIA: A dated record of food actually is served is maintained on file for at least 4 weeks after the corresponding menu date.
ASSESSMENT METHOD: Observe to determine if dated records of food served are on file for the required time.
Note: See sample “Weekly Menu Planner”.
(4) A written record of the dates and times at which emergency and disaster plan
drills were conducted pursuant to COMAR 13A.16.10.01A(3)(c); and
INTENT: A written record of emergency and disaster plan drills must be maintained so that compliance with this regulation can be assessed.
INSPECTION REPORT ITEMS: “Program Records”
COMPLIANCE CRITERIA:
 A written log or similar document is maintained that records the date and time of each emergency evacuation drill.
 The dates indicate the emergency fire evacuation drills took place at least monthly.
 The dates indicate other emergency and disaster evacuation drills took place at least twice per year.
ASSESSMENT METHOD: Review facility records for evidence that evacuation drills occur as required.
(5) A current copy of this subtitle at the center so that it is displayed and freely available for reference by parents and center staff;
INTENT: A complete copy of current center licensing regulations (COMAR 13A.16, Child Care Centers) must be present and displayed for review by center employees and parents.
INSPECTION REPORT ITEM: "Program Records"
COMPLIANCE CRITERIA: A complete copy of current center licensing regulations
is displayed where it can be readily accessed by center staff and parents.

(1) The fees for and provision of care;
(2) The center’s child discipline policy;
(3) The presence at the center of any pet animals;
(4) If applicable, the use of volunteers in the child care center; and
(5) If overnight care is to be provided to the child, the sleeping arrangements
approved by the parent.
INTENT: This information is necessary to protect the health and safety of children in care.
INSPECTION REPORT ITEM: “Program Records”
COMPLIANCE CRITERIA: The center maintains written agreements for all children
in care.
ASSESSMENT METHOD: Review center records to determine if there is a written agreement for each child in care.
.04 Child Records.
A. For each child admitted to, or continuing in care, the operator shall maintain written records, on forms provided or approved by the office that meet the requirements of this regulation.
COMAR 13A.16.03 Management and Administration

COMAR 13A.16.03 Management and Administration
 INTENT: The operator must keep complete, current, and accurate records of all children served by the program.
INSPECTION REPORT ITEM: "Child Records"
COMPLIANCE CRITERIA: The center maintains written records for each child in
care.
ASSESSMENT METHOD: Review center records to determine if there is a written record for each child in care.
Notes:
 Compliance with requirements of this regulation is further assessed at §§ B-J, as applicable.
 Certain information or forms, i.e., Emergency Card, Health Inventory, Parental Permission Slips, etc., required for each child may be found in the child’s individual file or may be consolidated in a centrally located file.
 For information not found in the child’s individual record, ask Operator or Director if required information is housed elsewhere within the facility.
 Reviewing Child Records: Child Care Centers are generally approved to serve large numbers of children. It is extremely time-consuming for licensing staff to inspect large numbers of child records during an inspection given the complexity and amount of information required to be checked for each record. To decrease time spent in this area, while ensuring that the provider maintains appropriate child records, Licensing Specialists may proceed as follows:
 Randomly select 10 child records, creating a mixture of all infant and toddler records with some preschooler records, and review for compliance with the following:
 §.04 of this Chapter, Child Records, A.–K., as applicable;  Chapter .09, §.02 Activity Plans; and,
 Chapter .12, §.06 Infant Feeding, as applicable.
 When a noncompliant record is reviewed, cite the noncompliance on the inspection form (be sure to use the canned comment) and cease inspecting child records.
 Inform the Director that a noncompliance was found; therefore, all child records must be checked for completeness and accuracy. (You may note this directive in the additional comment section.)
COMAR 13A.16.03 Management and Administration
   August 29, 2016

COMAR 13A.16.03 Management and Administration
 B.
 Ask the Director to contact you when all child records are compliant with regulations.
 Inform the Director that upon your return, you will randomly select another 10 child records to check.
 If all records checked in this random selection are compliant, the child record noncompliance will be noted as corrected.
 If non-compliances are found, the “N” will stand as cited until the Licensing Specialist finds no non-compliances during the random sampling review of child records.
 Licensing Specialist must discuss further follow-up with the Supervisor
Each child's written records shall be:
(1) Readily accessible to all staff members providing care to the child; and
(2) Kept on file at the center during the period of a child's enrollment and for 2
years after the child's disenrollment.
INTENT: Center staff must be able to easily access child records at all times. Records must be retained for at least 2 years after a child’s disenrollment.
INSPECTION REPORT ITEM: "Child Records"
COMPLIANCE CRITERIA: All required records are accessible to all center staff members providing care to children, and are retained for at least 2 years unless specified otherwise by regulation.
ASSESSMENT METHOD: Review records required to be maintained by the center, and observe location of child records for ease of accessibility.
C. The operator shall obtain and maintain emergency information from the child's parent that:
(1) Includes the child's name and date of birth;
(2) Includes the parent's full name, current address, and home and work telephone
numbers;
(3) Includes the name and telephone number of the individual who is authorized to
pick up the child each day;
(4) Includes the name and telephone number of at least one individual who is
authorized to pick up the child in an emergency;
(5) Includes the name, address, and telephone number of the child's physician or
other health care provider;
(6) If the child has a special health condition, includes emergency medical
instructions for that condition;
(7) Is signed and dated by the child's parent;
(8) Is updated as needed, but at least annually; and
COMAR 13A.16.03 Management and Administration

E.
(1) Includes a parental statement of the child's health status;
(2) If applicable, includes a statement of allergies; and
(3) Includes a medical evaluation, signed and dated by a physician that states the
child is medically cleared to attend child care and is based on an examination completed by the physician within the last:
(a) 2 months before admission for a child younger than 9 months old;
(b) 3 months before admission for a child between 9 and 24 months old; or
(c) 12 months before admission for a child 2 years old or older.
If the child is younger than 6 years old, there shall be documentation that the child has received an appropriate lead screening as required by State or local law, unless the child is a school-age child who attends a school-age program located in the child’s school.
INTENT: To help decrease the damaging effects of lead poisoning in children, Maryland law requires each child under the age of 6 years to have an appropriate lead screening.
INSPECTION REPORT ITEM: “Child Records”
COMAR 13A.16.03 Management and Administration
COMAR 13A.16.03 Management and Administration
 (9) Is readily accessible to each staff member supervising the child, including during an off-site activity.
INTENT: For each child, center staff must always know whom to contact in an emergency involving the child. At a minimum, emergency contact information must include certain items and must be reviewed by parents to make sure that it’s accurate and complete.
INSPECTION REPORT ITEM: “Child Records” COMPLIANCE CRITERIA:
 The center maintains a completed emergency information form for each child in care.
 The form used is an OCC 1214 “Emergency Form" or an equivalent document that has been approved by the Regional Office for use.
 Each form has been signed and dated by the child’s parent or guardian. ASSESSMENT METHOD: Review child records to verify that a completed emergency
information document is present for each child.
D. Unless a parent objects to a child's medical examination because of bona fide religious beliefs and practices, a health assessment of the child shall be provided by the child's parent that:
August 29, 2016
Page 13 of 32

COMAR 13A.16.03 Management and Administration
 COMPLIANCE CRITERIA: Each child in care younger than 6 years old has received appropriate lead screening.
ASSESSMENT METHOD: Review children’s files to determine if and when the center received the required documentation.
Notes:
 Three, four and five year old children who are enrolled in public or nonpublic school are considered school-age children. If the child attends a school-age program located in the child’s school, the assumption is that documentation of lead screening would be on site in the school’s file.
 The child’s parent is responsible for making sure the child has received a lead screening.
 The child’s physician is responsible for ensuring that the child received the appropriate lead screening.
 If a child has been tested but the health practitioner does not have the test date, the local health department in the jurisdiction where the child lives can help the child’s parent get a record of the test results.
 The zip codes of the at-risk areas that require blood lead testing are listed on the back of the Health Inventory form. When a child registers to begin school, the Form 1215 will meet the requirements for school entry. For this reason, parents should be encouraged to keep a copy of the form for school registration purposes.
F. A medical evaluation and, if applicable, documentation of an appropriate lead screening that are transferred directly from a registered family child care home, another licensed child care center, or a public or nonpublic school in Maryland may be accepted as meeting the requirements of §§D(3) and E of this regulation.
G. Unless a school-age child attends a school-age program located in the child’s school, the operator shall obtain, and maintain at the center, an immunization record showing that:
(1) The child has had immunizations appropriate for the child's age which meet the immunization guidelines set by the Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene;
(2) The child has had at least one dose of each vaccine appropriate for the child's age before entry and is scheduled to complete the required immunizations;
(3) A licensed physician or a health officer has determined that immunization is medically contraindicated according to accepted medical standards; or
COMAR 13A.16.03 Management and Administration
 August 29, 2016
Page 14 of 32

COMAR 13A.16.03 Management and Administration
 (4) The parent objects to the child's immunization because it conflicts with the parent's bona fide religious beliefs and practices.
INTENT:
 To minimize health risks to children, the center must obtain and maintain an immunization record for each enrolled child which demonstrates that each child has had immunizations appropriate for the child’s age per the guidelines of the Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DHMH).
 To minimize the possibility of an adverse reaction to an immunization to occur while the child is in care at the center, the child must have had at least one dose of each vaccine appropriate for the child’s age before entry into the center and the date of dosage must be recorded on the immunization record.
INSPECTION REPORT ITEMS: “Child Records”
COMPLIANCE CRITERIA: Children’s files contain an immunization record that
complies with (1) – (4), as applicable, of this regulation.
ASSESSMENT METHOD: Review children’s files to determine if the files contain immunization documentation.
Notes:
 If an immunization or specific immunizations are medically contraindicated, the file or immunization record must indicate such as recorded by a licensed physician or a health officer.
 If a parent objects to a child’s immunizations or specific immunization(s) because of bona fide religious beliefs and practices, the immunization record of the child must contain a statement from the parent indicating such objection.
 For guidance in checking immunization records during an inspection see the DHMH Age-Appropriate Immunization Chart schedule, and “Checking Immunization Records During Inspections”.
H. If a parent objects to a child's immunization or medical examination, or both, because of the parent's bona fide religious beliefs and practices, an operator shall require the parent to provide a health history of the child and sign a statement indicating that to the best of the parent's knowledge and belief, the child is in satisfactory health and free from any communicable disease.
COMAR 13A.16.03 Management and Administration
 August 29, 2016
Page 15 of 32

COMAR 13A.16.03 Management and Administration
 INTENT: To provide for parent’s bona fide religious beliefs and practices, a parent may opt out of the child immunization requirement or medical examination requirement, or both by providing a written statement of the child's health status in lieu of an immunization record and medical evaluation.
INSPECTION REPORT ITEM: “Child Records”
COMPLIANCE CRITERIA: A written (signed and dated) statement from the parent that the child is in satisfactory health and free from any communicable disease is included in the child's program admission records of each child whose parent objects to having the child immunized or medically examined because of religious beliefs and practices.
ASSESSMENT METHOD: Review the child's file. If the file does not contain a medical examination or record of immunizations, determine if a written, signed, and dated parental statement indicating objection to a medical examination or immunizations, or both, is present.
I. The operator shall record or maintain on file:
(1) Each incidence of acute illness requiring exclusion of the child from care
pursuant to COMAR 13A.16.11.01;

Page 17 of 32

COMAR 13A.16.03 Management and Administration
  The signatures and dates of the parent/guardian and the center representative of the most recent review/update of the information of the child’s individual needs.
ASSESSMENT METHOD:
 For each child who has been enrolled in the center for more than 12 months, review the child’s file to determine if there is a written statement from the parent/guardian about the child’s individual needs that has been updated at least every 12 months.
 Ensure that the updated information has been signed and dated by the operator and the parent/guardian.
K. An operator shall maintain daily records of the amounts and kinds of liquids and solid food consumed by each infant and toddler. These records shall be:
(1) Dated and kept on file for at least 4 weeks;
(2) Available in the infant or toddler feeding area; and
(3) Made available to the child's parent.
INTENT: In order to ensure that center staff and the parents/guardians of each infant and toddler (children under age 2 years) are aware of the foods and liquids consumed each day by the child, the type and amount of food and drink consumed by that infant or toddler must be recorded daily, be available in the infant and/or toddler feeding area, and made available to the parent of the infant or toddler.
INSPECTION REPORT ITEM: “Child Records” COMPLIANCE CRITERIA:
 A feeding record that lists the amounts and kinds of liquids and solid foods consumed by each infant and toddler is completed each day the child is in attendance.
 The daily feeding records of each infant and toddler are maintained at the center for at least 4 weeks.
 The infant/toddler feeding records are available in the feeding area(s).

 If the infant/toddler has been enrolled for less than four weeks, determine if the child’s record contains a daily feeding record that spans the time period for which the infant/toddler has been in attendance.
 Observe the feeding area(s) to determine if current daily feeding records are located there for each infant and toddler.
 Interview the Operator to determine how the daily feeding records are made available to parents of infants and toddlers.
Note: For more guidance on infant feeding, see Chapter .12, §.06.
.05 Staff Records.
Notes:
 Some Operators, with facilities at multiple sites, keep staff records at a central location. Since inspections are unannounced, staff records may not be on site upon arrival of the licensing specialist. In those instances, the Operator must be given the opportunity to get the records to the site before the inspection is completed.
 Some Operators keep staff records locked in a confidential file at all times. When an operator is not available during an unannounced inspection and the person in charge does not have access to the locked records, schedule a follow-up visit (the next business day) to review the records.
 Some operators keep staff records in a computerized system which is acceptable. The operator shall:
A. Maintain and, upon request by the office, submit a current and complete list of personnel, on a form supplied or approved by the office, that includes each individual, whether paid or unpaid, who works at the center on a routine basis;
INTENT: To help ensure the safety of children in care, the operator must maintain a current and complete list of all facility employees and must make that list available to OCC.
INSPECTION REPORT ITEM: "Staff Records"
COMPLIANCE CRITERIA: A current and complete Employment Record is maintained which lists all current personnel and is provided to the Regional Office upon request. OCC Form 1203 Personnel List/Change Form is used for this purpose.
ASSESSMENT METHOD: Review the facility files to determine if a current and complete Employment Record is present and compare with OCC 1203 Personnel
COMAR 13A.16.03 Management and Administration
  August 29, 2016
Page 19 of 32

COMAR 13A.16.03 Management and Administration
 List/Change Form or an alternative form approved by the Office, and the CCATS Associated Party list for that facility.
Notes:
 Child care centers may maintain a computerized version of the employment record and may submit to OCC as an alternative to OCC 2013 Personnel List/Change Form. The computerized format must contain all elements noted on the OCC 1203.
 On a routine basis, a center's Employment Record is reviewed by the Regional Office in conjunction with each unannounced inspection of the facility in accordance with policy, “Verifying Staff Employment in Child Care Facilities During Annual Unannounced Inspections”.
 The Employment Record is subject to review by the Regional Office at other times as well (for example, in connection with a complaint investigation).
 The Regional Office may request the center to submit the current Employment Record in advance of an unannounced inspection.
 If the Employment Record is not reviewed in advance, it will be reviewed on-site during the inspection.
B. For review by the office and by parents who have enrolled their children or are considering enrolling their children, post in a conspicuous location a current and complete staffing pattern, on a form supplied or approved by the office, that specifies:
(1) The number and ages of children enrolled;
(2) The staff/child ratio in relation to the daily schedule; and
(3) By staff name, all child care assignments;
INTENT: So that OCC, parents/guardians of children in care, and visitors may verify that the center is complying with staff/child ratio and maximum group size requirements, the operator must post current and complete staffing pattern form(s).
INSPECTION REPORT ITEM: “Staffing Pattern Posted”
COMPLIANCE CRITERIA: A current and complete Staffing Pattern form, either OCC 1206, or an alternative form that has been approved by the Regional Office is posted for each child activity room.
COMAR 13A.16.03 Management and Administration
 August 29, 2016
Page 20 of 32

COMAR 13A.16.03 Management and Administration ASSESSMENT METHOD:
 Observe to determine if all necessary staffing pattern forms are posted in a conspicuous location in the center.
 Review each form for currency and completeness.
Notes:
 A center must post its current staffing patterns in a conspicuous location in the center. The staffing patterns do not have to be posted in each classroom. Collective posting at a single location (for example, on a main bulletin board) is acceptable.
 On a routine basis, a center's Employment Record is reviewed by the Regional Office in conjunction with each unannounced inspection of the facility.
 The Employment Record is also subject to review by the Regional Office at other times (for example, in connection with a complaint).
 The Licensing Specialist should be careful to link review of the staffing patterns to review of the Employment Record to ensure that properly trained staff are providing required coverage at all times.
C. During an individual's employment at the center and for 2 years after the date of the individual's last employment there, maintain a record for each individual that includes:
(1) The individual's:
(a) Training, if required under this chapter;
(b) Experience, if required under this chapter; and
(c) Function or position;
(2) Verification that the staff member's age complies with the minimum required for the position held;
(3) An employment medical evaluation;
(4) Criminal background check results, except that the operator shall destroy the
record of those results immediately after the last day of the individual’s
employment; and
(5) The date on which the staff member received the written information required
by COMAR 13A.16.06.02;
INTENT: During the employment of each person, the operator must maintain a record of the person’s employment medical evaluation, job qualifications and duties, training completed while employed, federal and State criminal background check results, and
COMAR 13A.16.03 Management and Administration
  August 29, 2016
Page 21 of 32

COMAR 13A.16.03 Management and Administration
 date when the required staff orientation was received. This record must be maintained for 2 years after the person is no longer employed.
INSPECTION REPORT ITEM: "Staff Records"
COMPLIANCE CRITERIA: A record containing the required information is
maintained for:
 Each current employee; and
 Each ex-employee for two years after the end of the person’s employment. ASSESSMENT METHOD: Review the records of current employees and ex-employees
to determine if compliance criteria are met.
Notes:
 Due to the confidentiality requirements for CBCs, copies of the criminal background results should not be in the employee’s record for OCC review.
 The process found in “Checking Staff Continued Training in Child Care Centers Guidelines” may also be used to check staff records for compliance with this regulation.
D. Maintain documentation required for:
(1) Substitutes, pursuant to COMAR 13A.16.06.13; and
(2) The adult available for emergencies, pursuant to COMAR 13A.16.08.02D(3);
and
E. Maintain a calendar or other written record of the:
(1) Days on which a substitute provides care; and
(2) Staff member in whose place the substitute worked.
INTENT: In order that the Regional Office can assess the center's compliance with requirements regarding the use of substitutes, pursuant to Chapter .06, Regulation .13, the center must maintain a written record of the days each substitute provided care to enrolled children and identify the staff member for whom the substitute worked.
INSPECTION REPORT ITEM: "Staff Records"
COMPLIANCE CRITERIA: For each substitute used by the center, there is a record of all of the dates the substitute was used and the name and job title of the person(s) the substitute replaced.
ASSESSMENT METHOD: Review the facility files for each substitute used by the facility to determine if the required records are present.
COMAR 13A.16.03 Management and Administration

COMAR 13A.16.03 Management and Administration
 .06 Notifications. The operator shall:
A. Within 5 working days of its occurrence, provide written notification to the office about the:
(1) Addition of a new employee or staff member that includes:
(a) The individual’s full name, date of birth, and date of hire;
(b) Information about the individual's work assignment; and
(c) Signed and notarized permission to examine records of abuse and neglect of
children and adults for information about the individual; and
INTENT: To enable OCC to determine if each new employee or staff member meets all applicable requirements of Chapter .06 of these regulations, the operator must provide OCC with certain hiring-related documentation at the earliest possible time.
INSPECTION REPORT ITEM: “Notification of New Employee”
COMPLIANCE CRITERIA: Within 5 business days after a new employee’s start date, the operator provides the Regional Office with a completed “Child Care Facility Personnel List/Staff Change Form”, OCC 1203.
ASSESSMENT METHOD: Review the facility’s current Employment Record to identify recent hires. If there have been recent hires, review the facility’s licensing file to determine if a “Child Care Facility Personnel List/Staff Change Form” form), and a completed “Release of Information” form OCC 1260, have been received as required for each new hire.
Note: To curtail unnecessary CJIS Alerts, request the Operator or Director to inform the office of individuals no longer employed at the facility, or who were never employed after getting CBCs. The “Child Care Facility Personnel List Staff Change Form” may be used for this purpose.
(2) Ending of employment, for whatever reason, of an individual that includes the:
(a) Individual’s full name; and
(b) Date of the individual’s last day of employment.
Note: OCC 1203 Personnel List/Staff Change Form is used for reporting purposes.
B. Within 15 working days of adding the new employee or staff member, provide to the office:
(1) If applicable, documentation that the individual meets the requirements of this chapter for the assignment, unless documentation already is on file in the office; and
COMAR 13A.16.03 Management and Administration
  August 29, 2016
Page 23 of 32

COMAR 13A.16.03 Management and Administration
 (2) If the individual is paid by the center operator, proof of compliance with the laws and regulations pertaining to criminal background checks;
INTENT: To ensure that new employees are qualified for the positions for which they were hired, and that those individuals are in compliance with criminal background check laws and regulations.
INSPECTION REPORT ITEM: “Notification of New Employee”
COMPLIANCE CRITERIA: As applicable, within 15 business days after a new employee’s start date, the operator provides the Regional Office with documentation that the individual meets the regulatory requirements, if any, for the individual’s job assignment. [NOTE: This documentation need not be submitted to OCC if the individual is identified in the Child Care Automated Tracking System (CCATS) as an associated party for another child care facility in the same position].
Notes:
 All new facility employees must apply to CJIS for a State and FBI record check. If, however, a new employee has previously had a State and FBI record check done and OCC has received the results from CJIS, the person is “known” to OCC and may begin child care duties before the results of the new record check application are returned (i.e., the new employee need not be “chaperoned” pending receipt of the new CBC application results).
 In the case of a multi-site operator, if an employee transfers from one site to another, a new record check application is not required. Since the person's employer remains the same regardless of the person's actual job site location, the person is not considered to be a new employee; therefore, the background check requirements for new employees do not apply.
 CJIS “365-Day Requests”:
 If a new employee's previous employer was a child care facility, school,
adoption or foster care agency, children's recreation center, or similar program or service for children, and if CJIS received a Maryland State and FBI record check request on that person from the previous employer within the year, the person's current employer may file a "365-Day Request" with CJIS.
 The 365-day request is made by submitting a special CJIS form, authorizing CJIS to send the results of that previous record check to the new employer and to the appropriate OCC Regional Office.
 Results are usually received by the new employer and the Regional Office within 3-4 days after a properly completed request reaches CJIS.
COMAR 13A.16.03 Management and Administration
  August 29, 2016
Page 24 of 32

COMAR 13A.16.03 Management and Administration
  Facility operators may obtain copies of the 365-Day Request form and instructions for completing the form by calling CJIS Customer Service at (410) 764-4501.
 There is no fee for filing a 365-Day Request form.
 The operator must submit two copies of the special 365-Day Request form to
CJIS. One copy should include the operator's authorization number, and the other copy should include the appropriate Regional Office's authorization number. Without these authorization numbers, CJIS will not know where to send the record check results.
 The operator should photocopy the completed request form and forward the photocopy to the OCC Regional Office as proof that the 365-Day Request has been submitted.
 State and FBI record check results received on the basis of a 365-Day Request will be accepted by OCC in lieu of a brand-new criminal background check application. If, however, CJIS rejects the 365-Day Request for any reason, the new employee will have to submit a new criminal background check application.
 Whenever submitting a criminal background check (CBC) request for a center employee, the operator must include the appropriate OCC Regional Office authorization number on the CBC request form. The following is a list of the Regional Office authorization numbers:
 Authorization Number 1100000016
   1100000020

 The plan for using the alternative site shall be evaluated periodically.
 The operator must send a letter to parents notifying them that the licensed
center is temporarily closing during the emergency. In addition, the operator must post a notice at the licensed center notifying the public that the center is temporarily closed.

met by an alternative which complies with the intent of the regulation; and
(3) For a limited period of time as specified by the office, or for as long as the license
remains in effect and the operator continues to comply with the terms of the variance.
INTENT: To permit an applicant or operator who cannot reasonably meet a regulation’s literal requirements, to meet the intent of the regulation in an alternative way that protects the health, safety, or well-being of each child in care.
Notes:
 Under Maryland law, the Office of Child Care does not have authority to grant an
exemption from any regulation.
 All center licensing regulations exist primarily to protect the health, safety, and welfare of each child in care; therefore, OCC will only grant a variance if doing so will not diminish that protection.
 A variance is an acceptable way of meeting the intent of a regulation without meeting the regulation’s literal requirements.
 To request a variance, the applicant or operator must submit a completed “Variance Request” form OCC 1213, along with any relevant supporting documentation, to the Regional Office.
 In making the request, the applicant or operator must propose an alternative and demonstrate how that alternative will fully satisfy the regulation’s intent.
COMAR 13A.16.03 Management and Administration
 August 29, 2016
Page 31 of 32

COMAR 13A.16.03 Management and Administration
  Each variance is granted only under certain conditions, and the applicant or operator must continue to meet those conditions.
 If the variance is granted, it has the same force and effect as the regulation, and the applicant or operator must comply fully with all of its terms and conditions.
INSPECTION REPORT ITEM: “Variances”
COMPLIANCE CRITERIA: The applicant or operator has followed procedures for requesting a variance to a regulation, if applicable, and the variance has been granted by the office.

see if a variance is in effect and, if so, what its nature and duration are.
 If a variance is in effect at the time of a routine licensing inspection, the Licensing Specialist assesses compliance with the terms of the variance.
B. Within 30 calendar days of receiving a completed request for a variance, the office shall notify the operator that the variance has been granted or denied.
C. If a variance request is denied by a regional office of the Agency:
(1) The operator may appeal the denial to the Agency's central office; and
(2) The Agency's central office has the final determination of whether or not a
variance is granted.
D. A variance to sanitary facility requirements that is granted pursuant to COMAR
13A.16.05.08C does not apply to any subsequent additions or enlargements to the center.

 .01 Complaints.
The office shall investigate both written and oral complaints that relate to a violation of a regulation, including anonymous complaints, and prepare a written report of the findings.
INTENT: As the agency responsible for regulating child care centers and assessing their compliance with licensing regulations, the Office must investigate all complaints of regulatory violations and prepare a written record of findings. Any person may file a complaint, and the complaint may be verbal or written.
Notes: Complaints alleging a violation of child care center licensing laws or regulations are handled in the following manner:
 The Regional Office accepts complaints that are filed in person, telephonically, or in writing by letter, fax, or e-mail.
 A complainant does not need to identify him/herself. Anonymous complaints are accepted.

 Investigation of Priority 2 complaints must be initiated within ten (10)
business days.
 Complaints are recorded by the Regional Office on a Complaint Intake form in the Child Care Administrative Tracking System (CCATS).

COMAR 13A.16.17 Inspections, Complaints, and Enforcement
  A parent or business that currently uses (or is considering using) the child care center.
 Any information related to Child Protective Services must be redacted by the Regional Office prior to releasing the Record of Complaint in response to a PIA request.
 Complex PIA requests or PIA requests from Attorneys must be referred to the Office of the Attorney General for processing.
.02 Inspections.
A. An operator shall permit inspection of all areas of the center by an agency
representative during the center's hours of operation.
INTENT: Maryland law requires the Office to inspect each licensed center to determine if the center is complying with all applicable requirements. As a condition of licensing, the center operator must allow Office licensing personnel to conduct an inspection at any time during the center’s approved operating hours.
Notes:
 Except as noted under §D of this regulation, if the operator does not permit inspection of the center during approved operating hours, the center license may be suspended or revoked. If entry to the center is refused, the Licensing Specialist must immediately notify the Regional Manager, and the Regional Manager must immediately notify the OCC Legal Enforcement Unit.
 If children are heard or seen on the premises and the operator refuses entry of OCC staff, the Licensing Specialist must call the local police.
 All inspection must be conducted in a manner exhibiting good customer service. (see “Customer Service – Referenced in Manual”)
 All findings of compliance and noncompliance must be noted by the Licensing Specialist in ELIS.
 “Non-compliances” and “Discussed” items are automatically summarized in the “Summary of Findings” in ELIS.
 The entire inspection report consists of the completed “Inspection Report” form and the “Summary of Findings.”
COMAR 13A.16.17 Inspections, Complaints, and Enforcement August 29, 2016
 Page 2 of 12

COMAR 13A.16.17 Inspections, Complaints, and Enforcement
  The “Summary of Findings” (non-compliances and discussed items) are reviewed with the operator, and the operator may request a “Review of Findings” if there is any disagreement with the findings.
 The inspection report is signed by the operator and the Licensing Specialist.
 The inspection report is emailed or mailed to the operator.
B. An agency representative may make inspections without prior notice to an operator.
INTENT: To determine if all children in care continue to be safe and are receiving ongoing proper care and supervision, Office licensing personnel may make an unannounced inspection of the center at any time during the center’s approved hours of operation.
C. Upon request, an operator shall make the records required by this subtitle available to an agency representative for inspection and copying.
INTENT: The operator must allow Office licensing personnel to inspect all records maintained in connection with the center license and, if necessary, to temporarily remove any such record from the center in order to copy it.
D. An operator may request satisfactory identification from an agency representative before admitting the agency representative for an inspection.
INTENT: For the protection of center personnel and the children in care, the operator may ask Office licensing personnel for identification before permitting entry to the center.
Notes:
 At all times while on duty, each Office licensing staff member shall carry and be prepared to display valid State of Maryland employee identification.
 If an Office staff member cannot or will not produce valid State of Maryland employee identification, the operator may deny the staff member entry to the center.
E. An agency representative shall inspect each center:
(1) On an announced basis before the office issues an initial license or a continuing
license; and
COMAR 13A.16.17 Inspections, Complaints, and Enforcement August 29, 2016
 Page 3 of 12

COMAR 13A.16.17 Inspections, Complaints, and Enforcement
 (2) On an unannounced basis, at least once within each 12-month period after the date that an initial license or a continuing license was issued.
INTENT:
 To validate compliance with the child care center licensing regulations, the Regional Office will conduct an announced inspection before an initial or continuing license is issued.
 To validate ongoing compliance with the child care center licensing regulations, the Office will conduct an unannounced inspection at least once every 12 months after the issuance of an initial or continuing license and at least 30 days prior to the anniversary date.
Note:
 An announced conversion inspection may be conducted on the same day as the 2nd 12- month “initial license” unannounced inspection; however, a separate ELIS report must be completed for each type of inspection. See “Establishing Anniversary Dates and Coordinating Inspections”.
 Routine unannounced inspections may be "piggybacked" onto monitoring visits as well as complaint investigations; however, a separate ELIS report must be completed for each type of inspection. See “Establishing Anniversary Dates and Coordinating Inspections”.
 During unannounced visits, oftentimes a facility may not be available for inspection due to the absence of the provider, the provider is not currently providing care, or the facility is simply closed. For guidance in addressing these issues, see “Non Responsive Providers and Providers Not Providing Care”.
F. An operator may contest a finding of noncompliance with this subtitle by requesting a review of findings by the regional office or the central office of the Agency.
INTENT: If the operator believes that a finding of noncompliance was wrong or unfair, the operator may ask for a review of that finding by OCC management staff.
Notes:
The following are the steps for appealing a finding of noncompliance:
COMAR 13A.16.17 Inspections, Complaints, and Enforcement August 29, 2016
  Page 4 of 12

COMAR 13A.16.17 Inspections, Complaints, and Enforcement
 1. Upon completion of the inspection, the Operator checks the box on the first page of the ELIS “Summary of Findings,” indicating that a review of findings is requested, or make the request to the Regional Office, via writing or email, within 30 days of the inspection.
2. The Licensing Specialist notifies the Regional Manager/designee of the request.
3. The Regional Manager/designee reviews the inspection data in ELIS and sends a letter to the operator outlining the findings of the review.
 If the operator requests a meeting and at that meeting the issues are not resolved, the Regional Manager/designee contacts the Program Manager of the OCC Licensing Branch.
 Instead of agreeing to meet with the Regional Manager/designee, the operator may choose to contact the Licensing Branch Program Manager directly. In this event, the Regional Manager/designee shall:
 Give the operator the name and telephone number of the Program Manager, and
 Call the Program Manager to summarize the situation, provide pertinent background information, and present the recommendation of the Regional Office.
.03 Intermediate Sanctions.
A. Upon a determination that an operator has violated the regulations in this subtitle, placing the health, safety, or welfare of children in care at risk, the office may:
(1) Restrict the ages or number of new children enrolled;
(2) Reduce the number of children in care;
(3) Require the operator or center staff to participate in training in a specified content area;
(4) Increase the frequency of monitoring of the center during a specified period of time;
(5) Enter into an agreement with the operator detailing requirements for remedying violations and achieving compliance; and
(6) Notify, or require the operator to notify, a parent of a child who may be affected by the situation for which an intermediate sanction has been imposed.
INTENT: As an alternative to suspending or revoking the center’s license, the Regional Office may pursue an intermediate sanction which places certain limits or conditions on center operations. An intermediate sanction should be seen as an opportunity for the
COMAR 13A.16.17 Inspections, Complaints, and Enforcement August 29, 2016
Page 5 of 12

COMAR 13A.16.17 Inspections, Complaints, and Enforcement
 Regional Office to work closely with the operator to help bring the center into satisfactory compliance.
Notes:
 An intermediate sanction may be voluntary on the part of the operator, or involuntary:
 Voluntary – for example, a compliance agreement
 Involuntary – for example, the Regional Office imposes a reduction in center
capacity or a limitation on the number or ages of children approved for care
 Involuntary sanctions carry appeal rights, but voluntary sanctions do not. For additional information on “appeals” refer to the following:
 “Request for Hearing/Appeal” form, OCC 1281
 COMAR 13A.16.18, Administrative Hearings (Chapter 18 of this Manual)
 A limitation on admission of children or a reduction in capacity may be imposed immediately on an emergency basis if deemed necessary to protect children from imminent harm.
 A voluntary compliance agreement must be in writing, signed by the operator and
the Regional Office representative, and include a statement of:
 Facts about the noncompliant situation that resulted in the agreement,
 The respective responsibilities of the operator and the Regional Office under
the agreement, and
 The consequences to the operator of failing to observe the terms of the
agreement.
 The timeframe in which the compliance agreement will be in effect.
B. If the office determines that an operator has violated a condition or requirement of the sanction, the office may suspend or revoke the operator's license.
INTENT: The operator must abide by all the terms of the agreement. Failure to do so may result in suspension or revocation of the center’s license.
.04 Suspension.
A. The office may suspend an operator's license for a period of not more than 60 calendar days:
(1) Upon determining that the:
(a) Regulations in this subtitle have been violated; and

COMAR 13A.16.17 Inspections, Complaints, and Enforcement
 (a) Conditional status has lapsed; and
(b) Operator has failed to meet the requirements for reinstatement of the
continuing license.
INTENT: The Office of Child care may suspend a center license for up to 60 days if there are regulatory non-compliances that create a risk to children in care, or if the terms under which a conditional license was issued have not been satisfied.
B. The office shall notify the operator in writing of the license suspension by certified mail 20 calendar days in advance, and the notice shall specify:
(1) The effective date and period of the suspension;
(2) The reason for suspension;

health, safety, or welfare of a child in the center no longer is threatened;
(8) That the suspension may lead to revocation; and
(9) That the operator is required to surrender the license to the office when the
suspension becomes effective.
INTENT: In accordance with due process requirements, the Regional Office must notify the operator about the reason(s) for the suspension, the operator’s right to appeal the suspension, and how to exercise that right.
Notes:
 If the operator requests a hearing within the required timeframe, the suspension does not begin until after the hearing decision. Until that time, the operator may continue to operate. If the suspension action is upheld, the operator must cease providing care until the Office determines that the children in care are no longer threatened.

  Page 7 of 12

COMAR 13A.16.17 Inspections, Complaints, and Enforcement
 INTENT: Parents need to know about the suspension so they can make an informed decision about whether to leave their children in care at the center if it continues to operate pending an appeal hearing.

D. By the end of the suspension period, the office shall:
(1) Reinstate the license and return it to the operator; or
(2) Revoke the license.
INTENT: The Regional Office has until the end of the suspension period to determine if the violation(s) leading to the suspension have been sufficiently corrected. Based on that determination, the Office must either permit the operator to re-open the center or move to revoke the center’s license.
.05 Emergency Suspension.
A. The office may suspend an operator's license on an emergency basis if it is determined that this action is required to protect the health, safety, or welfare of a child in the center.

 C. The office shall notify the parents of the children in care of the emergency suspension.
INTENT: Parents must be notified so that they have an opportunity to make alternate child care arrangements as they deem necessary.
Notes:

COMAR 13A.16.16 Educational Programs in Nonpublic Nursery Schools
 (3) Mathematical and scientific thinking;
(4) Social studies;
(5) The arts; and
(6) Physical development and health.
INTENT: The program must have, and follow, a written educational curriculum in specified cognitive, social, and physical skill domains that is appropriate to the ages and developmental levels of the children served by the program.
INSPECTION REPORT ITEM: “Educational Program” COMPLIANCE CRITERIA:
 The program has a written curriculum for each class that addresses each of the listed content areas;
 In each class, the curriculum is appropriate to the age and developmental level of the children in that class.
 In each class the curriculum is implemented; and
 A copy of each class curriculum is kept on site.
ASSESSMENT METHOD: Evaluate compliance through observation, interview, and/or
review of the written curriculum.
Notes:
 There is no single, prescribed curriculum design, format, or presentational method that all approved programs must follow. Instead, each program is free to use any design, format, or presentational method that it chooses as long as the content of the curriculum followed in each class clearly addresses each listed area on a daily basis.
 For a mixed-age class, a written curriculum for each age represented in the class must be implemented and maintained.
 Various kinds of early childhood curricula may be reviewed at the facility for approval. Examples of acceptable curricula include, but are not limited to, the following:
 Commercial Curricula. There are hundreds of different commercial curricula for early childhood education. Some examples are:
 The Creative Curriculum for Preschoolers
 High/Scope
COMAR 13A.16.16 Educational Programs in Nonpublic Nursery Schools August 29, 2016
 Page 20 of 28

COMAR 13A.16.16 Educational Programs in Nonpublic Nursery Schools
  The Calvert School curriculum
 The A Beka curriculum
 Religious Curricula. There are numerous religious curricula. Some examples
are:
 Christian  Catholic  Judaic
 Islamic  Lubavitch
 Curricula of Different Philosophies. Some curricula adhere to a specific philosophy of education. Some examples are:
 Montessori
 Waldorf
 Local School System Curriculum:
 Some operators use the curriculum that a local school system implements
for its Early Elementary Education Program (EEEP) for a 4-year-old
nursery school program.
 Some operators adapt a local school system pre-kindergarten curriculum
for a 3-year-old or 4-year-old nursery school program.
 Independent Curricula:
 Developed by the specific nursery school.
 Often curricular areas are developed around themes (My Community,
Farm Animals, The Zoo, Weather, Holidays).
 Internet sources – limitless resources for curricula
 What to look for when reviewing written curricula:
 Ensure that there is a written curriculum for each age group for which
approval is sought (2-year-olds, 3-year-olds, and/or 4-year-olds).
 Ensure that each curriculum includes the following areas of instruction:  Personal and social development
 Language and literacy development
 Mathematical and scientific thinking
 Social studies
 The arts
 Physical development and health
Note: Subject titles used by the operator in its written curriculum may not exactly match the subject titles used in the regulations, for example:
 Personal and social development may be titled “All About Me”
COMAR 13A.16.16 Educational Programs in Nonpublic Nursery Schools August 29, 2016
 Page 21 of 28

COMAR 13A.16.16 Educational Programs in Nonpublic Nursery Schools
  Language and literacy development may be titled “Pre-Reading Skills”  Mathematical thinking may be titled “Numeracy” or “Measuring”
 Scientific thinking may be titled “Discovery”; “How Things Grow”
 Social studies may be titled “My Community”
 The arts may be titled “Music and Movement” or “Free Expression”  Physical development may be titled “Gross Motor Activities”
 Health may be titled “Taking Care of My Body”
 Regardless of the name or type of curriculum that a nursery school uses, it must, at a minimum, include all of the curricular areas required by §A(1)-(6) of this regulation.
 If you are unsure if all of the required areas of instruction are covered in the curriculum, ask the operator to identify each area of instruction using the curricular areas specified in §A(1)-(6) of this regulation.
 Do not require the operator to change the terms used in the program’s curriculum, because that is the program's working document. Simply ask the operator to indicate the curricular areas specified in §A(1)-(6) of this regulation to ensure that all required areas are included.
B. Instructional Materials and Equipment. The operator shall own and maintain the nonpublic nursery school instructional materials and equipment required to implement the written curriculum of the educational program specified in §A of this regulation.
INTENT: Instructional materials and equipment are items that are provided for use by enrolled children and are needed to implement the curriculum in each class. There must be sufficient items to permit full implementation of the curriculum. To ensure that these items will always be available and ready for use, the operator must own and maintain them on site.
INSPECTION REPORT ITEM: “Educational Program”
COMPLIANCE CRITERIA: All items necessary for implementing the curriculum in
each class are:
 Owned and maintained on site; and
 Present in sufficient quantity for full implementation of the curriculum.
ASSESSMENT METHOD: Evaluate compliance through observation of materials.
COMAR 13A.16.16 Educational Programs in Nonpublic Nursery Schools August 29, 2016
Page 22 of 28

COMAR 13A.16.16 Educational Programs in Nonpublic Nursery Schools Notes:
 §B of this regulation does not specify a required number of items the nursery school must have in order to implement the educational program. You should use observation and professional judgment to determine whether the quantity of items is adequate for the curriculum and the number of children enrolled in the program.
 When reviewing the list of instructional materials and equipment:
 Ensure that the list of instructional materials and equipment correlates to the specific areas of instruction required by §A(1)-(6) of this regulation:
 Personal and social development
 Language and literacy development
 Mathematical and scientific thinking  Social studies
 The arts
 Physical development and health
 If the list does not identify the materials and equipment by the instructional areas specified in §A of this regulation, return the list and ask the operator to list the materials and equipment under the curricular areas specified in §A(1)- (6) of this regulation.
 Ask the operator to explain any material and /or equipment item that may be unfamiliar.
 If the list does not include items under all of the six areas of instruction required by the regulations, it is incomplete and un-approvable until complete.
.08 Child Records.
A. The operator of an educational program in a nonpublic nursery school shall maintain a cumulative record for each child enrolled in the educational program.
B. Each child's record shall include the:
(1) Nonpublic nursery school's name;
(2) Nonpublic nursery school's address;
(3) Nonpublic nursery school's telephone number;
(4) Child's first, middle, and last names;
(5) Child's month, day, and year of birth;
(6) Child's home address;
(7) Month, day, and year the child initially entered the educational program;
(8) Age on enrollment in the educational program;
(9) Month, day, and year the child withdrew from the educational program, if
applicable;
COMAR 13A.16.16 Educational Programs in Nonpublic Nursery Schools August 29, 2016
   Page 23 of 28

COMAR 13A.16.16 Educational Programs in Nonpublic Nursery Schools
 (10) Child's performance information in each curricular area; (11) Code for the meaning of performance information; and (12) Number of days the child attended in each school year.
INTENT: The operator shall maintain a continuing record for each enrolled child that contains information specifically identifying the nursery school and the child, the child’s enrollment and attendance dates, and the child’s program performance.
INSPECTION REPORT ITEM: “Child Records”
COMPLIANCE CRITERIA: For each child, a cumulative record is kept on site that
contains all of the required information that applies to that child.
ASSESSMENT METHOD: Evaluate compliance through review of program’s cumulative record form.
Notes:
 A cumulative record may be the child’s transcript or a combination of the center licensing record together with the cumulative record file on the child as long as the combined records contain all the information in §B of this regulation. The requirement of §A of this regulation to maintain a "cumulative record for each child enrolled" means that the operator must have one record form for each child on which to record specific information for that child for the entire period of time the child is enrolled in the educational program.
 The cumulative record is not the same as a progress report (which is sometimes called a "report card" or a "report to parents").
 Progress (or performance) information from the report to parents is usually transferred to the cumulative record form that is maintained at the school.
 Each child’s cumulative record form must be maintained throughout the period of time that a child is enrolled in the educational program.
 Since nursery school attendance is not required before entering kindergarten, the cumulative record of a child is usually not requested by a receiving school; however, a parent might request a copy of it when the child leaves the educational program.
 Some operators use commercial student record forms. Some operators design their own student record form. Any record form is acceptable as long as it contains spaces, at a minimum, for all of the information required by §B(1)-(12) of this regulation.
COMAR 13A.16.16 Educational Programs in Nonpublic Nursery Schools August 29, 2016
   Page 24 of 28

COMAR 13A.16.16 Educational Programs in Nonpublic Nursery Schools
  A school’s cumulative child record form may require additional information that the operator feels is important to be included.
 When reviewing the document submitted as the cumulative record form, check for:
 Accurate, full, official name of the nursery school as reflected on the application form and on the center’s license or letter of compliance.
 Complete and accurate location address of the nursery school. (Note: Sometimes an operator with more than one center will submit a record form with the location address of another center.) Ensure that the address on the form is the location address of the nursery school and not a Post Office box address or the address of the corporate or off-site office.
 Ensure that the telephone number is the telephone number of the nursery school and not that of the corporate or off-site office.
 Space for the child’s first, middle, and last names (in order preferred by the operator)
 Space for the child’s month, day, and year of birth.
 Space for the child’s home address.
 Space for the month, day, and year the child initially entered the educational
program.
 Space to record the age of the child upon enrollment in the educational
program.
 Space for the month, day, and year of the child’s withdrawal (promotion,
graduation, etc.) from the educational program.
 Space for performance information in each curricular area for each school
year.
 Code for the meaning of the performance information. (Some operators use a
narrative format for performance information for early childhood programs.
Operators who use this format can indicate “narrative” for the code.
 Space for the total number of days the child was present for the educational
program in each school year.
 If the form submitted as the cumulative record form does not provide for one or more of the items referenced in §B(1)-(12) of this regulation, or if it contains inaccurate identifying information, it is not approvable.
 If the form contains fields to record information that does not apply to the nursery school (such as elementary or secondary school subjects, local school system identifying code, name or location address of another school), it is not approvable.

INTENT: In order to hold a child care center license or letter of compliance, the operator of an educational program located in a licensed center or letter of compliance facility has already met most of the child record-keeping requirements listed under §B of this regulation. Records maintained for licensing compliance purposes may also be used for educational program compliance purposes.
D. Age of Admission.
(1) Except as provided by §D(2) of this regulation, a child shall be 2 years old, 3
years old, or 4 years old on or before September 1 of a school year to be age- eligible for admission during that school year to a nonpublic nursery school program approved under this chapter.
(2) A nonpublic nursery school may adopt policies and procedures permitting, on request by a child's parent or guardian, and if a nonpublic nursery school determines that a child demonstrates capabilities warranting early admission, a:
(a) 2 year old child to be admitted to a 3 year old nursery school program; or
(b) 3 year old child to be admitted to a 4 year old nursery school program.
INTENT: To be enrolled during a given school year, a child must have reached the age of 3 years or 4 years by the start of that school year. Exceptions allow a 2 year old child to be admitted early to a program for 3 year old children, or a 3 year old to a program for 4 year old children, upon approval of the program following request from the child’s parent.
INSPECTION REPORT ITEM: “Child Records” COMPLIANCE CRITERIA:
 Except under early admission, each child in a 3-year-old program or a 4-year-old program became 3-years-old or 4-years-old, respectively, by September 1 of the current school year.
 For each 2-year-old child in a 3-year-old program, and each 3-year-old child in a 4-year-old program:
 The child’s parent has made a request for the child’s early admission; and
 The operator has determined that early admission is developmentally
appropriate for the child.
.09 Health, Fire Safety, and Zoning.
A. An operator shall obtain and maintain documentation verifying current compliance with health, fire safety, and zoning regulations applicable to a nonpublic nursery school.
COMAR 13A.16.16 Educational Programs in Nonpublic Nursery Schools August 29, 2016
Page 26 of 28

COMAR 13A.16.16 Educational Programs in Nonpublic Nursery Schools
 INTENT: The property of the nursery school must be safe for children and must comply with all applicable State and local codes. The nursery school operator must obtain all necessary health, fire, and zoning certifications and keep records of those certifications.
INSPECTION REPORT ITEM: “Health, Fire Safety, and Zoning” COMPLIANCE CRITERIA: Documentation is maintained on site showing that the
nursery school is in full current compliance with all applicable State and local codes.
ASSESSMENT METHOD: Inspect the nursery school files to verify that documentation of current compliance is present.
B. In a licensed child care center or a letter of compliance facility, the requirements of §A of this regulation are met by complying with pertinent health, fire safety, and zoning requirements set forth under COMAR 13A.16 or COMAR 13A.17, as applicable.
INTENT: In order to hold a child care center license or letter of compliance, the operator of an educational program located in a licensed center or letter of compliance facility has already met all applicable State and local code requirements. Relevant documentation obtained in connection with a license or letter of compliance may also be used for educational program approval purposes.
.10 Procedures and Sanctions for Noncompliance—Educational Programs.
If the Department believes that a nonpublic nursery school does not meet the conditions or standards on which the certificate of approval of the school was based, the Department shall implement procedures and sanctions for noncompliance approved by the State Board.
INTENT: The State Board, through The Division of Early Childhood Development’s Office of Child Care, may move to sanction an educational program for noncompliance with the requirements of COMAR 13A.16 – Child Care Centers, as set forth in Education Article §2-206.
Notes:
 Suspension or revocation of the educational program approval. If the Division moves to suspend or revoke the approval of the educational program of a nursery school operator and the operator wishes to appeal that action, the appeal will be heard by the State Board of Education.
 The DECD Office of Child Care shall provide to the operator a written notice of the action that also contains a statement of the operator’s right to appeal to the State Board.
COMAR 13A.16.16 Educational Programs in Nonpublic Nursery Schools August 29, 2016
  Page 27 of 28

COMAR 13A.16.16 Educational Programs in Nonpublic Nursery Schools
  The operator shall have a period of 20 days to file a written request for appeal with the State Board.
 If the operator does not request an appeal within 20 days after the notice of action, the action becomes effective 15 days later.
 If a timely appeal request is made to the State Board, the State Board shall hold a hearing within 60 days to decide to approve or to deny the action by the Office of Child Care.
 If the action is approved by the State Board, it shall take effect 15 days after the date of the State Board’s determination unless the operator files for judicial review of the State Board’s determination. The operator’s right to judicial review is fully set forth under Maryland’s Administrative Procedures Act, State Government Article §10-222.
 Suspension or revocation of a child care license or letter of compliance. If the Division initiates suspension or revocation of the child care license or letter of compliance of a nursery school that contains an approved educational program, the operator may appeal the action before the Office of Administrative Hearings (OAH).
 An educational program located in a nursery school that is required to have a license or letter of compliance is prohibited from operating if that license or letter of compliance is suspended or revoked.
 Even though approval to operate the educational program is automatically affected if the license enforcement action is upheld, an operator does not have a separate appeal right before the State Board for continued operation of the educational program once the license enforcement action is upheld.

updated, if necessary, by the parent each time the child is dropped off at the center.
INTENT: Center staff must know how to contact a child’s parent in the event of an emergency and must know if the child has a health or physical condition that may require particular attention. Because a drop-in center is not supposed to provide care to any child on a regular basis, this information must be reviewed each day that a given child is present.
INSPECTION REPORT ITEM: “Admission Requirements” COMPLIANCE CRITERIA:
 An “Emergency Form”, OCC form 1214, (Appendix B-5); and a “Health History Form For Use in Drop-In Child Care Centers”, OCC form 1285, (Appendix B- 20), are on file for each child admitted to care.
 On each day that a given child is in care, the child’s parent signs and dates the child’s Emergency Form and Health History Form.

     1 meal and 2 snacks or 2 meals and 1 snack
    11 to 14 consecutive hours
   2 meals and 2 snacks or 3 meals and 1 snack
  INTENT: Growing children burn a lot of energy, so their energy levels must constantly be restored through frequent meals and snacks.
INSPECTION REPORT ITEM: "Food Service"
COMPLIANCE CRITERIA: Each child receives the appropriate number of meal(s)
and/or snack(s) based on the length of a child’s daily attendance.
ASSESSMENT METHOD: Review child attendance records to determine how long children are in care daily, and cross-reference those records with the facility’s meal/snack schedule to determine if children are getting the appropriate number of meals and/or snacks.
D. If an operator chooses not to provide meals, the operator shall make arrangements with the parent of each child to provide food for meals.
INTENT: While a child is in attendance, the operator is responsible for the child’s appropriate nutrition. Part of this responsibility is making sure that the child receives foods that meet USDA/CACFP (United States Department of Agriculture/Child and Adult Care Food Program) guidelines.

furnished by the center for meals and snacks; and
(2) Keep a dated record of food actually served in the center, and to each child on a
modified diet, on file for at least 4 weeks, correcting the planned menu if necessary.
INTENT: Proper menu planning is critical to ensuring that children in care get nutritional and appropriate amounts of food and beverages each day. Parents have a right to know what food is being served to their children and when. A menu provides them with this knowledge. For the same reason, and because last-minute changes to planned menus are sometimes necessary, a record of food actually served must be kept for a reasonable period of time.
INSPECTION REPORT ITEM: "Food Service" COMPLIANCE CRITERIA:
 A menu for the current week is posted where it is readily visible to parents.
 A dated record of food actually is served is maintained on file for at least 4 weeks
after the corresponding menu date.

(1) Has been prepared and processed in a licensed food service facility or in a
licensed food processing plant; or
(2) Consists of a snack or party food which is not potentially hazardous and does
not present a significant risk of transmitting food-borne disease.
INTENT: An outside food service may be used only if it is properly licensed or if the food items provided by the service do not require special handling or processing.
COMAR 13A.16.11 Nutrition August 29, 2016
 Page 5 of 19

COMAR 13A.16.12 Nutrition INSPECTION REPORT ITEM: "Food Sources"
COMPLIANCE CRITERIA: The outside food service is either duly licensed or provides low-risk food.
ASSESSMENT METHOD: Review the contract or service agreement with the outside food service to determine:
 The nature of the food items to be provided by the service, and
 If the items are not low-risk, whether the service is duly licensed.
C. An operator may not provide to the children home-canned goods or any other hermetically sealed food prepared in a place other than a licensed food processing establishment.
INTENT: Because they carry a high risk of food-borne illness if not processed correctly, canned or jarred foods may not be used unless they come from a properly licensed commercial source.
INSPECTION REPORT ITEM: “Food Sources"
COMPLIANCE CRITERIA: All canned and jarred food items come from a licensed
commercial source.
ASSESSMENT METHOD: Observe canned and jarred food items to determine their sources.
D. An operator:
(1) Shall provide only fluid milk and fluid milk products that are:
(a) Pasteurized Grade A;
(a) Except as provided by §D(3) of this regulation, served from the original
container; and
(b) Not more than 4 days older than the expiration date marked on the original
container;
(2) Except as provided at Regulation .06D of this chapter, may use dry milk, dry
milk products, or reconstituted dry milk only for cooking purposes; and
(3) For meals and snacks, may serve milk family-style from a pitcher or similar
container into which the milk has been poured from the original container.
INTENT: Milk and milk products are classified as “potentially hazardous food” because they are especially susceptible to contamination and spoilage. Milk or a fluid milk product may not be served if it is 4 days beyond its “sell-by” date. Fluid milk substitutes
COMAR 13A.16.11 Nutrition August 29, 2016
 Page 6 of 19

COMAR 13A.16.12 Nutrition
 do not have the same nutritional value as Grade A fluid milk and may not be used for drinking purposes.
INSPECTION REPORT ITEM: "Food Sources"
COMPLIANCE CRITERIA:
 Only pasteurized Grade A milk and fluid milk products are used for direct consumption.
 No milk or fluid milk product present at the facility is more than 4 days beyond its “sell-by” date.
ASSESSMENT METHOD:
 Observe mealtime to determine if only proper milk and fluid milk products are
used for direct consumption. If observation is not possible, interview facility staff to determine what type of milk is used.
 Observe milk and fluid milk containers to determine if any are more than 4 days after the ”sell-by” date.
Notes:
 Maryland Health Department regulations, COMAR 10.15.06.03D, require that milk and milk products be consumed within no more than 4 days after the “sell-by” date in “eating and drinking establishments, hospitals, schools, institutions, and similar places where milk is consumed on the premises.”
 Milk is classified as a “potentially hazardous food” as defined in Chapter .01, §.02B(44)(a), because its high protein content supports rapid growth of bacteria. The operator must ensure that milk is served immediately after pouring and that the container with any remaining milk is re-refrigerated immediately. The shelf life of milk decreases rapidly if not kept at or below a temperature of 45o F. When opening a milk container, care must be taken to avoid contaminating the container’s lip or spout. If possible during a facility inspection, the Licensing Specialist should assess the proper handling and storage of milk containers that have been opened for use.
.04 Food Storage and Preparation.
A. An operator shall:
(1) Protect all food from contamination while it is being stored, transported, or
displayed; and

Note: Microwave ovens may not be used to heat bottled formula because they heat liquids unevenly, which creates a scalding risk for infants.
C. Except as specified by §D of this regulation, an operator may serve an infant or toddler only developmentally appropriate:
(1) Commercially prebottled formula;
(2) Breast milk, formula, juice, or water which has been prebottled for the child and
provided by the child's parent;
(3) Commercially processed baby food that is opened and used the same day;
(4) Commercial infant formula, in concentrate, powder, or ready-to-feed form, if
the:
(a) Child's parent has provided prior written authorization for the use of the
formula; and
(b) Formula is prepared directly from a factory-sealed container and in
accordance with the manufacturer's instructions; and
(5) Other foods supplied by the operator or the parent that are consumed the same
day.
INTENT: A child who is under 2-years-old may only be served developmentally appropriate food and drink. Except for pre-bottled formula and pre-bottled breast milk, juice, or water provided by the child's parent, food must either be consumed by the child on the same day it is served.
INSPECTION REPORT ITEM: “Infant Feeding”

COMAR 13A.16.12 Nutrition COMPLIANCE CRITERIA:
 Each child under 2-years-old receives only developmentally appropriate food and drink.
 Except for pre-bottled formula and pre-bottled breast milk, juice, or water from the infant's parent, served food is either consumed on the same day or discarded.
ASSESSMENT METHOD
:
 Observe the food and drink served to each child who is under 2-years-old to
assess its developmental appropriateness.
D. Only whole, pasteurized milk will be served to an infant or toddler who is not receiving formula or breast milk, except that skim milk, reconstituted nonfat dry milk, or 1—2 percent milk may be served upon the written prior approval of the child's parent and health care provider.
E. An operator shall ensure that:
(1) All infant foods and bottles are labeled with the infant's name, dated, and
refrigerated at 40° F or below if potentially hazardous;
(2) All nipples on bottles are protected;
(3) Breast milk or formula which has been bottled for the child is:
(a) Placed immediately in a refrigerator when brought to the center;
(b) Warmed to the desired temperature immediately before feeding; and
(c) Served to the child at a temperature that is safe and conducive to the child's
comfortable feeding;
(4) Foods that present a high risk of choking for infants and toddlers are not served
to them; and
(5) Reusable bottles and nipples are:
(a) Reused only after they have been washed, rinsed, and sanitized; or
(b) If supplied by the child's parent, rinsed after use and returned daily to the
parent.
INTENT: Food consumed by infants is typically very rich in protein and therefore potentially hazardous if not prepared or stored properly. The operator must store all infant food promptly at proper temperatures, label and date all food intended for a given infant, ensure that bottle nipples are protected from contamination, and return reusable feeding equipment to each infant’s parent every day. Food items that carry a high choking risk may not be served.

 .01 Exclusion for Acute Illness.
A. Child care staff shall:
(1) Monitor a child for signs and symptoms of acute illness;
(2) Notify a child's parent or other designated person upon observing a sign or
symptom of acute illness; and
(3) Provide temporary isolation for the affected child in a suitably equipped
separate area within sight and hearing of an adult.
INTENT: To prevent the spread of illness and to protect all the children in care, facility staff must observe children for any signs of acute illness and promptly notify a child’s parent if the child appears to be ill. A child in attendance who becomes acutely ill must be kept away from the other children and constantly monitored by facility staff until the child’s parent can take the child home.
INSPECTION REPORT ITEMS: “Exclusion for Acute Illness” COMPLIANCE CRITERIA:
 Parental notification:
 Each child is monitored throughout the day for signs of illness.
 If a child shows any signs of acute illness, the child’s parent or other
authorized adult is promptly notified and requested to take the child home.
 Isolation area:
 An acutely ill child is isolated in a suitable area away from the other children and kept under sight-and-sound staff monitoring.
ASSESSMENT METHOD: If the facility has a procedure regarding acutely ill children, review it to determine whether it reflects the requirements of this regulation. As needed, interview facility staff to determine how acute illness situations are handled and where the isolation area is located. If acute illness episodes have occurred, review applicable child records for evidence of parent notification.
B. Except in centers for children with acute illness, an operator may not admit a child to care or allow a child to remain in care when the child is exhibiting symptoms of acute illness.
INTENT: An acutely ill child requires closer observation and care and may be a source of contagion for other children in care; therefore, the operator may not allow a sick child to attend care unless OCC has approved the facility to provide care for acutely ill children. (See Chapter .13 in this Manual for requirements regarding approval of centers for children with acute illness).
COMAR 13A.16.11 Health August 29, 2016
Page 1 of 14

COMAR 13A.16.11 Health
 INSPECTION REPORT ITEM: “Exclusion for Acute Illness” COMPLIANCE CRITERIA:
 There are no acutely ill children in attendance, or
 If in attendance, an acutely ill child is separated from the other children, closely monitored by a responsible adult, and is waiting to be picked by the child’s parent or other authorized adult.
ASSESSMENT METHOD:
 Observe to determine if any acutely ill child is present.
 If an acutely ill child is present, observe to determine if the child is maintained
separate from the other children.
Notes:
 For help in identifying signs of acute illness, see “Signs of Illness in Children”.
 A history of seizures that are not related to acute illness is not grounds for exclusion from care.
 It is recommended that the operator inform parents at the time children are enrolled and again at the time they are first admitted of the requirement to exclude children for acute illness. The operator is encouraged to include a statement to that effect in whatever written agreement or service contract is used for child enrollment purposes.
C. A child may not be readmitted to care after an absence of 3 days or more due to illness without a written statement from the parent or physician that the child may return to a regular schedule.
INTENT: An illness requiring a child to be kept out of care for 3 or more days is serious enough to require a written statement that the child is well enough to return to care. This requirement helps protect the facility operator and staff as well as the other children in care.
INSPECTION REPORT ITEM: “Exclusion for Acute Illness”
COMPLIANCE CRITERIA: For each occurrence of a child’s absence for at least 3 days due to illness, there is a written statement from the child’s parent or physician that the child is well enough to return to regular care.
COMAR 13A.16.11 Health August 29, 2016
 Page 2 of 14

COMAR 13A.16.11 Health
 ASSESSMENT METHOD: Interview facility staff to determine if any children have been re-admitted after illness absences of 3 or more days, then review applicable child records to determine if the required statements have been submitted.
.02 Infectious and Communicable Diseases.
A. An operator shall immediately transmit to the health officer a report of the name and address of a child or a staff member who appears to be infected with a reportable communicable disease or who has been exposed to a reportable communicable disease as indicated in COMAR 10.06.01.03.
INTENT: A “reportable communicable disease” is any one of a group of highly infectious or contagious illnesses classified by the Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DHMH) as serious threats to public health that must be identified, isolated, and treated immediately. For this reason, any incidence of these diseases must be reported to the local health department immediately.
INSPECTION REPORT ITEM: “Infectious and Communicable Diseases”
COMPLIANCE CRITERIA: Immediately upon learning that a child enrolled in care or a facility employee has or may have a reportable disease, the operator contacts the local health department.
ASSESSMENT METHOD: Interview facility staff as necessary to determine if there has been an incidence of a reportable disease, then review facility records for evidence that the required report was made.
Notes:
 There are currently almost seventy diseases classified by DHMH as “reportable.” The occurrence of any of these diseases must be reported immediately to the local health department, and some of them must be reported telephonically. A complete list of reportable diseases and the reporting requirements pertinent to facility operators are set forth in “COMAR 10.06.01 – Communicable Diseases and Related Conditions of Public Health Importance”.
 Operators may obtain additional information about reportable diseases and reporting requirements from the DHMH Epidemiology and Disease Control Program website, www.edcp.org – click on the “Reportable Diseases” tab, or by calling the local health department.
B. Except in centers for children with acute illness, an operator may not knowingly admit to care or retain in care a child with a transmissible infection or a communicable disease during the period of exclusion recommended for that
COMAR 13A.16.11 Health August 29, 2016
  Page 3 of 14

COMAR 13A.16.11 Health
 infection or disease as shown on a chart provided by the office, unless the health officer grants approval for the child to attend child care during that period.
INTENT: Exclusion from care for a specified period due to having a specified communicable disease is necessary to protect the health of other children in care.
INSPECTION REPORT ITEM: “Infectious and Communicable Diseases”
COMPLIANCE CRITERIA: Unless approved in writing by a physician to return to care sooner, no child with one of a specified group of communicable diseases is returned to care until the recommended period of exclusion from care has been completed.
ASSESSMENT METHOD:
 Observe to determine if any child with signs of a transmissible infection or
communicable disease is in attendance.
 Interview facility staff to determine if and how a child known or believed to be in the communicable stage of an infection or disease is kept out of care.
 Review facility records to determine if a copy of the DHMH “Communicable Disease Summary” is present for facility staff reference.
Notes:
 Under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990, persons with certain health/medical conditions (e.g., HIV/AIDS) are considered to have a disability and may not be denied admission to care, or continuation in care solely on the basis of that disability. For more information about ADA requirements as they may apply to the facility, refer to “Child Care and the ADA”.
 Confidentiality should be maintained at all times. The child’s physician is not required to disclose information to any caregiver without written release of information from a parent or guardian.
 Facility staff should always take appropriate precautions whenever coming into contact with blood or other bodily fluids or excretions, or with items that have been contaminated with such substances.
 For infection control precautions and measures that OCC expects all child care programs to use, see “General Sanitation Guidelines”.

 .03 Preventing Spread of Disease.
A. A written hand washing procedure approved by the office shall be posted at each sink used for washing hands.
B. Hands shall be washed according to the posted approved procedure by a center employee, volunteer, or child in care at least:
(1) After toileting or diapering;
(2) Before food preparation or eating; and
(3) After an outdoor activity or handling an animal.
INTENT: To prevent the spread of infection and illness, adults and children must wash
their hands properly after touching potentially contaminated items or substances. INSPECTION REPORT ITEM: “Preventing Spread of Disease” COMPLIANCE CRITERIA:
 Each employee and each child practices frequent handwashing.
 Soap and warm running water are used to wash hands, when available; or, a
hand sanitizer is used for children who are 2-years-old or older.
 Staff members wash the hands of children who are not capable of washing their own hands, as required, using soap and warm running water.
 Staff members always wash their hands after changing diapers.
 No one washes hands in a food service/preparation sink to keep germs away from
food.
 Facility personnel always follow OCC’s approved handwashing procedure (see
“Handwashing Procedure”.
ASSESSMENT METHOD: Observe how and when hands are washed. If observation is not possible, interview facility personnel to determine how, when, and where handwashing is done.
Notes:
 Animals, including pets, are a potential source of disease. Not only must hands be washed after handling animals, the center must take precautions to prevent the occurrence of disease through animal-related contamination of food areas and the lack of proper pet sanitation. See "Animals in Child Care Facilities" for guidance on maintaining pets and other animals in a child care facility.
COMAR 13A.16.11 Health August 29, 2016
 Page 5 of 14

COMAR 13A.16.11 Health
  Hand sanitizing gels may be used only during off-site activities and similar situations when soap and water are not available. Ethyl alcohol is the active ingredient in most sanitizing gels. The gels often have more than 80% alcohol content, which is higher than normally found in hard liquors. Hand sanitizing gels, therefore, have the potential for toxicity in very young children and infants who explore their world through hand-mouth activities. Because children frequently place their hands in their mouths, they could be poisoned through the ingestion of even small amounts of hand sanitizers. Ingestion of as little as an ounce or two by a small child could be fatal, so hand sanitizers must be kept out of the reach of children and used with great caution.
C. Diapering shall be performed in accordance with a written diapering procedure approved by the office.
INTENT: Diapering is an obvious source of contamination that presents risk of disease. To reduce this risk, hygienic diapering procedures must be followed at all times.
INSPECTION REPORT ITEM: “Preventing Spread of Disease” COMPLIANCE CRITERIA:
 OCC’s approved diapering procedure, “Procedure for Diapering a Child”, is posted above or near each diapering area; and
 Facility staff always follow the approved procedure. ASSESSMENT METHOD:
 Observe diapering to determine if it is done according to the approved procedure.
 If observation is not possible, interview facility staff to determine the procedure
used for diapering. Notes:
 To help prevent the spread of disease, it is recommended that facility staff wear single-use disposable gloves during diapering. The gloves should be discarded immediately after diapering, and hands should be washed according to the approved handwashing procedure.
 Since some people are sensitive to latex, consideration should be given to using disposable vinyl gloves.

 .04 Medication Administration and Storage.
A. Medication Administration.
(1) Medication, whether prescription or non-prescription, may not be administered
to a child in care unless:
(a) Parental permission to administer the medication is documented on a
completed, signed, and dated medication authorization form, provided by the office, that is received at the center before the medication is administered; and
(b) A licensed health practitioner has approved the administration of the medication and the medication dosage.
INTENT: To prevent the unnecessary and inappropriate administration of prescription and nonprescription medication.
INSPECTION REPORT ITEM: “Medication Administration and Storage” COMPLIANCE CRITERIA: Unless exempted or approved, a nonprescription
medication is given only once per illness.
ASSESSMENT METHOD: Observe how nonprescription medication is administered. Review medication administration records to determine if the nonprescription medication is administered according instructions and that the first dose has not been administered while child was in care.
Note:
Nonprescription medication is over-the-counter medication that is prescribed by a physician to be administered to a child. “Over-the-counter Medication” are products found on store shelves which may be purchased by the general public without a prescription from a physician. For example, a physician may prescribe “Tylenol” for a child which is over-the-counter medication purchased by the general public.
(2) A prescription medication may not be administered to a child unless at least one dose of the medication has been given to the child at home.
(3) If the medication is by prescription, it is labeled by the pharmacy or physician with:
(a) The child's name;
(b) The date of the prescription;
(c) The name of the medication;
(d) The medication dosage;
(e) The administration schedule;
(f) The administration route;
(g) If applicable, special instructions, such as “take with food”; COMAR 13A.16.11 Health
  August 29, 2016
Page 7 of 14

COMAR 13A.16.11 Health
 (h) The duration of the prescription; and
(i) An expiration date that states when the medication is no longer useable.
INTENT:
 Medication may be administered to a child only if there is prior written, signed permission from the child’s parent.
 Prescription medication may be administered only if the medication is properly labeled and has not expired, and the parent has already given the medication to the child to be sure that the child will not have an adverse reaction.
INSPECTION REPORT ITEM: “Medication Administration and Storage” COMPLIANCE CRITERIA:
 Before giving medication to a child, the facility has on file for that child a completed, signed “Medication Authorization Form”, OCC form 1216, or an equivalent document which contains all information as required on the OCC form 1216.
 Each prescription medication:
 Is properly labeled by a physician or pharmacy and is current, and
 Has already been given to the child by the parent. ASSESSMENT METHOD:
 For each child receiving medication, review the child’s file to determine if a “Medication Authorization Form” (or an equivalent document) is present and when it was received.
 For each child receiving prescription medication:
 Examine the medication to determine if the medication is properly labeled and not expired.
 Review the child’s file for evidence of initial administration by the parent. Notes:
 If the prescription medication is properly labeled, the Medication Administration form does not have to be completed or signed by the physician. The information from the medication label could be noted on the medication administration form in the “Prescribers” section, with the parent/guardian completing the “Parent/Guardian Authorization” portion
COMAR 13A.16.11 Health August 29, 2016
 Page 8 of 14

COMAR 13A.16.11 Health
 of the form. Or, the provider could create a form to note the prescription information and parental authorization.
 While there is a place for a child’s picture on the Medication Administration form, the child’s picture is not required.
B. Topical Applications. A diaper rash product, sunscreen, or insect repellent supplied by a child's parent may be applied without prior approval of a licensed health practitioner.
Notes:
 Diaper rash products, sunscreen, and insect repellent are considered “Basic Care Products” not nonprescription medications. They are referred to as “Topical Applications” because they are applied on the child’s skin and not taken internally. An individual does not need to have taken “Medication Administration” training to apply basic care/topical products on a child.
 A parent may not give a provider a “home-made” product to use on the child. The product must be clearly labeled with a product name and instruction for use.
C. Medication shall be administered according to the instructions on the label of the medication container or a licensed health practitioner's written instructions, whichever are more recently dated.
INTENT: Because a child’s medication dosage or schedule may change, the medication must be given according to the most recent written instructions.
INSPECTION REPORT ITEM: “Medication Administration and Storage” COMPLIANCE CRITERIA: Each medication is given according to current instructions.
ASSESSMENT METHOD: Observe to determine if medication is given as instructed. If observation is not possible, review the child’s file and medication to determine if the medication is being given according to the written instructions.
D. Recording Requirements.
(1) Each administration of a prescription or non-prescription medication to a child,
including self-administration of a medication by the child, shall be noted in the child's record.
INTENT: Each time medication is given, a record must be made of what was given, who gave it, and when. The staff member trained in medication administration who
COMAR 13A.16.11 Health August 29, 2016
 Page 9 of 14

COMAR 13A.16.11 Health
administered the medication, must complete the log attached to the “Medication
Authorization Form”, OCC form 1216.
INSPECTION REPORT ITEM: “Medication Administration and Storage” COMPLIANCE CRITERIA: For each child receiving medication, a complete entry
is made in the child’s file each time medication is given.
ASSESSMENT METHOD: Review of the child’s file to determine if complete entries have been made.
Note: Child care staff must document each instance of a child self-administering medication. Using the Medication Administration Log, document the date, time and reason the medication was administered.
(2) Application of a diaper rash product, sunscreen, or insect repellent supplied by a child's parent shall be recorded in the child’s record.
Notes:
 A topical basic care product brought in by the parent does not have to be recorded each time it is applied on the child’s body. For example, the product could be recorded in the child’s record upon receipt from the parent/guardian, noting the date and the name of the product, and stating how the product is used, i.e., “The product is applied daily on the child”. If the parent/guardian changes the product, note in the child’s record, the name of the new product, the date received and how it is used.
 The “Medication Administration Log” should not be used for this purpose.
 Any method most convenient for the child care provider to record the application of topical products in the child’s record is acceptable.
E. MedicationStorage.
(1) Each medication shall be:
(a) Labeled with the child's name, the dosage, and the expiration date;
(b) Stored as directed by the manufacturer, the dispensing pharmacy, or the
prescribing physician; and
(c) Discarded according to guidelines of the Office of National Drug Control
Policy or the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, or returned to the child's parent upon expiration or discontinuation.
COMAR 13A.16.11 Health August 29, 2016
     Page 10 of 14

COMAR 13A.16.11 Health
 (2) All medications shall be stored to make them inaccessible to children in care but readily accessible to each employee designated by the operator to administer medication.
INTENT: In addition to keeping medications inaccessible to children, the operator must ensure that all child medications are stored properly.
INSPECTION REPORT ITEM: “Medication Administration and Storage” COMPLIANCE CRITERIA: Child medications are stored to maintain their potency.
ASSESSMENT METHOD: Observe to determine if medications are stored according to the medication’s label instructions.
Note: Medications requiring refrigeration must be stored in the center's refrigerator.
F. Effective July 1, 2011:
(1) Whenever children in care are present, there shall be at least one center
employee present who has completed medication administration training
approved by the office.
(2) Medication may be administered to a child in care only by an employee who has
completed approved medication training.
INTENT: Only individuals who have received approved medication administration training may administer medication to a child in care and there must be at least one such individual present at the center when enrolled children are present.
INSPECTION REPORT ITEM: “Medication Administration and Storage”
COMPLIANCE CRITERIA: The only staff members who administer medication to children in care are those individuals who have completed medication administration training that has been approved by the office and at least one such trained staff member is present at the center when children in care are present.
ASSESSMENT METHOD:
 Review staff training documentation to determine which staff members have
completed an approved medication administration training.
 Review the center’s Staffing Pattern to determine if at least one such trained staff member is scheduled to be present during the operational hours of the center.
COMAR 13A.16.11 Health August 29, 2016
 Page 11 of 14

COMAR 13A.16.11 Health
  Whenever possible, observe the administration of medicine to a child and verify if the individual administering the medication has had the approved medication administration training.
Note: If at any time, a life threatening medical crisis occurs, such as a child having an asthma or allergy attack, and a staff person who has taken medication administration is not available, the appropriate medication may be administered by a staff person to save the child’s life.
G. Section F of this regulation shall not apply if:
(1) The center employs a registered nurse, licensed practical nurse, or medication
technician certified by the Maryland Board of Nursing to administer medication
to children in care; or
(2) Responsibility for administering medication to children in care is delegated to a
center employee by a delegating nurse in accordance with COMAR 10.27.11.
H. Self-Administration of Medication.
(1) Before a child may self-administer medication while in care, the operator shall: (a) Have a written order from the child’s physician and the written request of
the child’s parent for the child’s self-administration of medication;
INTENT: To allow school-age children only who use inhalers and epi-pens to self- carry and self-administer these medications. No other medications may be self- administered.
Note: The “Asthma Action Plan” and/or the “Allergy Action Plan” may be used in lieu of the OCC 1216 Medication Administration Authorization Form for children who will self-carry/self-administer medication for asthma and/or allergies.
(b) In consultation with the child’s parent, establish a written procedure for self- administration of medication by the child based on the physician’s written order; and
(c) Authorize the child to self-administer medication.
INTENT: Once the parent and provider develop the procedures, the provider must
authorize the child to self-administer the medication.
(2) Revocation of Authorization to Self-Administer.
(a) An operator may revoke a child’s authorization to self-administer
medication if the child fails to follow the written procedure required by §H
(1) (b) of this regulation.
(b) Immediately upon revoking the child’s authorization to self-administer
medication, the operator shall notify the child’s parent of that revocation.
(c) The operator shall document the revocation of authorization to self-
administer and the notification to the child’s parent in the child’s record.
COMAR 13A.16.11 Health August 29, 2016

INTENT: Whenever transporting children in vehicles other than a school bus or contract motor coach, the operator must ensure that each child is properly secured as required by Maryland’s Child Passenger Safety Law.
INSPECTION REPORT ITEM: “Transportation”
COMPLIANCE CRITERIA: The vehicle used to transport children must be equipped with seat belts and age-appropriate car seats as specified by Maryland law (see Notes below).
ASSESSMENT METHOD: Observe the vehicle(s) used for transportation to ensure that seat belts and safety seats are present as required. As needed, interview facility staff to determine whether the seats and belts are used as required.
Notes:
 Maryland's Child Passenger Safety Law, §22-412 of the Transportation Article, Annotated Code of Maryland, requires that:
 Each child must be secured in a child safety seat if the child:
 Is younger than 6-years-old, regardless of the child’s weight; or  Weighs 40 pounds or less, regardless of the child’s age.
 If the child is younger than 16-years-old and weighs more than 40 pounds, he or she must be secured in a child safety seat or seat belt.
 Child safety seats must be installed in accordance with the safety seat and vehicle manufacturer’s instructions.
 The child is considered “secured” only if the safety seat or seat belt is used in accordance with the instructions of the safety seat manufacturer or the vehicle manufacturer.
 A safety seat or seat belt may not be used to secure more than one child at a time.
 OCC strongly discourages purchasing child safety seats at yard sales, garage sales, flea markets, etc., because there is no way of determining if the seats function properly, or have been damaged in some way that would make them unsafe for use.

 .01 Schedule of Daily Activities for All Children.
A. The operator shall prepare, post, and follow a written schedule of daily activities and offer activities that:
(1) Promote the sound emotional, social, intellectual, and physical growth of each
child;
(2) Are appropriate to the age, needs, and capabilities of the individual child;
(3) Include opportunities for individual and group participation;
(4) Include a balance between self-selected and staff-directed activities;
(5) Include a balance between active and quiet periods;
(6) Include periods of rest appropriate to the age, needs, and activities of the child;
and
(7) Include outdoor play in the morning and afternoon except that outdoor play
need not be included:
(a) When the weather is inclement; or
(b) In a before-school program.
INTENT: For each care day, the center must have a written schedule that provides activities that meet each child's individual and developmental needs while also allowing the child to engage in spontaneous activities and relationships.
INSPECTION REPORT ITEM: “Schedule of Daily Activities” COMPLIANCE CRITERIA:
 A written daily activity schedule is posted in each room or group.
 The schedule includes time periods for activities that:
 Promote social, intellectual, emotional, and physical growth (see details
below under Notes),
 Provide activity choice and activity balance (see details below under Notes),
and
 Unless precluded by bad weather, include twice-daily outdoor periods.
ASSESSMENT METHOD: Observe to determine if:
 A current, written activity schedule is posted, and
 The schedule includes time periods for activities that meet the compliance criteria listed above.
Notes:
 Each child develops at his or her own pace; however, there are general
developmental characteristics that children typically demonstrate at certain age levels. See "Developmental Characteristics", for information about these age
COMAR 13A.16.09 Program Requirements August 29, 2016

COMAR 13A.16.09 Program Requirements
 levels, and for some suggestions regarding toys and equipment appropriate to each age grouping.
 A resource of activities designed to promote child development is included. See “Suggested Daily Activities”.
 It is the responsibility of the parents to make sure their children have proper clothing. However, it is the operator's responsibility to ensure the health, safety, and welfare of each child at all times while the child is in care. This responsibility includes ensuring the child’s physical comfort with respect to temperature and activity. Although the center is not required to furnish clothing items to children in care, the operator is encouraged to keep a variety of spare clothing items on hand in case children's clothes get wet or soiled. If a child arrives at the center without proper or adequate clothing, the Director should:
 Arrange some alternate activity until the child has obtained the proper
clothing,
 Discuss the matter of proper clothing with the child’s parent at the earliest
opportunity, and
 Consider specifying clothing responsibilities in the service contract or
agreement the center has with the child's parent.
B. A before-school and after-school program schedule of activities shall take into consideration that the child has attended an instructional program during regular school hours.
INTENT: Because an instructional program includes activities intended to address a child's need for intellectual growth and stimulation, a before-school and after-school program may be permitted flexibility with respect to these areas of activity programming. The activities provided should complement the instructional day by primarily providing opportunities geared to the children's social, emotional, and physical needs.
C. Screen Time Activities.
(1) Definitions. In this section, the following terms have the meanings indicated:
(a) “Interactive technology” means educational and age-appropriate technology, including programs, applications (apps), noncommercial television programming, videos, streaming media, and ebooks that is designed to:
(i) Facilitate active and creative use of technology; and
(ii) Encourage social engagement with other children and adults.
(b) “Passive technology” means noninteractive television, videos, and streaming
media.
(2) Limited use of appropriate interactive technology may support, but may not
replace, creative play, physical activity, hands-on exploration, outdoor experiences, social interactions, and other developmentally appropriate learning activities for children 2 years old or older.

COMAR 13A.16.08 Child Supervision
 INTENT: Refer to the "Intent" statement under §C. above. In addition, staff/child ratio and group size requirements for a mixed-age group are based on the proportions of individual child ages within the group. Because younger children are more vulnerable and require closer attention, a higher proportion of younger children reduces the maximum allowable group size and requires a closer staff/child ratio.
INSPECTION REPORT ITEM: “Group Size and Staffing” COMPLIANCE CRITERIA: In each mixed-age group of children:
 The appropriate minimum staff/child ratio is maintained at all times, and
 The number of children remains at all times within the applicable maximum
group size.
ASSESSMENT METHOD: For each mixed-age group of children:
 Count and document the number of children present,
 Verify the ages of the children by reviewing the children's records,
 Review the daily attendance records to verify compliance with group size and age levels, and
 Review the Employment Record and Staffing Pattern, form OCC 1206, to determine if the number of staff are adequate and present as assigned.
(3) School-Age Groups. In a group where 3-year-old and 4-year-old children, enrolled in a public or nonpublic school, are mixed with school-age children, the following minimum staffing levels and maximum group size requirements apply:
   Group Composition
        Maximum Group Size
    Minimum Staffing Level
   Group includes up to five children 3 or 4 years old
    30
  1 school-age teacher and 1 assistant or aide
   Group includes 6 to 9 children 3 or 4 years old

 (2) A nursery school may not exceed a staff/child ratio or group size requirement set forth at §E(1) of this regulation, except that a Montessori school that has been approved by the Department may exceed a staff/child ratio or group size requirement by no more than 1/3.
(3) When children who are 2 years old, 3 years old, 4 years old, and 5 years old are grouped together, the average age of all the children in the group as of September 1 of that school year is used to determine the group's maximum size and staff/child ratio.
INTENT: In an instructional program operating under an MSDE Certificate of Approval, each class complies with the program's specified teacher-student ratio and class size established for the purpose of that Certificate.
INSPECTION REPORT ITEM: “Group Size and Staffing”
COMPLIANCE CRITERIA: During the approved hours of instruction, each class meets the applicable staff/child (teacher/student) ratio and does not exceed the applicable maximum class size.
ASSESSMENT METHOD: For each class, review daily attendance records and observe the number of staff (teachers) and children (students) present to determine if they meet applicable ratio and group size requirements.
Note: Requirements for nonpublic school approvals (K-12) are set forth in COMAR 13A.09.09. Under those regulations, an approved instructional program must operate in accordance with the school's written statement that specifies the ratio of students to teachers or the average class size for the implementation of the school’s educational program.

 .04 Variations in Group Size.
A. Group sizes for all ages may vary during outdoor play and special activities such as field trips and assemblies, only if the operator maintains the staff/child ratios required by this chapter.
INTENT: During outdoor play or certain recreational activities, it may not be practical or appropriate to the nature of the activity to adhere rigidly to the group size requirements specified in §.03 of this Chapter. Under these limited circumstances, the ordinary group size maximum may be exceeded, but only if the applicable minimum staff/child ratio is maintained at all times.
INSPECTION REPORT ITEM: “Variations in Group Size” COMPLIANCE CRITERIA:
 A group size maximum is exceeded only during outdoor play or a recreational activity where it is not feasible or appropriate to keep the children separated into discrete, identifiable groups.
 If the group size maximum is being exceeded under this provision, the applicable staff/child ratio is maintained at all times.
ASSESSMENT METHOD:
 Referring as necessary to the center's personnel list and staffing patterns, observe outdoor play groups and special recreational groups to determine if the required staff/child ratios are being maintained.
 If observation is not possible, interview the center director and other staff members as necessary to determine if and how maintenance of minimum ratios during outdoor play, off-site activities, etc., is ensured.
B. Groups containing only school age children may be of any size, pursuant to a plan approved by the office, if the staff/child ratios required by this chapter are maintained.
INTENT: School age children are capable of more self-direction than preschoolers, and their developmental needs and interests are more often met by participation in highly interactive, large-group activities. For these reasons, OCC may approve a written plan by an operator to organize school-age activities on a regular basis without regard to maximum group size, but only if the minimum staff/child ratio for school-aged children required by §.03 of this Chapter is maintained at all times during those activities.
COMAR 13A.16.08 Child Supervision August 29, 2016

COMAR 13A.16.08 Child Supervision INSPECTION REPORT ITEM: “Variations in Group Size”
COMPLIANCE CRITERIA: If the center has been approved by the Regional Office to have school-age groups larger than those permitted under §.03 of this Chapter, the center maintains the required staff/child ratio in each of those groups at all times.
ASSESSMENT METHOD:
 Referring as necessary to the center's personnel list and staffing patterns, observe school-age activity groups to determine if the required staff/child ratios are being maintained.
 If observation is not possible, interview the center director and other staff members as necessary to determine if and how maintenance of minimum ratios during school-age activity groups is ensured.
.05 Supervision during Water Activities.
A. An operator shall have prior written approval from a child's parent for the child's participation in a water activity.
INTENT: Swimming or wading involves potential safety risks, particularly for young children. The operator must obtain prior written permission from each child’s parent before allowing the child to swim or wade.
INSPECTION REPORT ITEM: “Supervision During Water Activities”
COMPLIANCE CRITERIA: If swimming/wading activities are conducted, there is a “Swimming/Wading Activity Permission” slip, or equivalent written authorization, from each child’s parent in the child’s file.
ASSESSMENT METHOD: Review of child files.
Note: See “Playground and Water Safety Guidelines”.
B. If a wading or swimming area is 4 feet or less in depth, each child engaged in a water activity shall receive continuous supervision by a staff member.
INTENT: Any water activity, including wading, is potentially dangerous, especially for small children; therefore, the operator must ensure that each child is appropriately supervised and constantly monitored whenever the child is in the water. The operator is responsible for each child’s safety at all times while the child is in care.
INSPECTION REPORT ITEM: “Supervision During Water Activities”
COMAR 13A.16.08 Child Supervision August 29, 2016
   Page 11 of 15

COMAR 13A.16.08 Child Supervision
 COMPLIANCE CRITERIA: Each child is supervised as required and monitored constantly by facility staff throughout a water activity.
ASSESSMENT METHOD: If possible, observe to determine if and how each child is being monitored and supervised; otherwise, interview facility staff to determine how the children are monitored and supervised during a water activity.
Notes:
 The operator may not permit a child in care to use a wading pool (such as a fill-and-drain molded plastic or inflatable pool) that does not have an operable circulation system approved by the local health department. Stagnant (uncirculated) pool water is a potential health hazard because it contaminates quickly; therefore, children may only use wading pools that have an approved and working circulation system.
 See “Playground and Water Safety Guidelines”.
C. If the water exceeds 4 feet in depth, there shall be a lifeguard present who:
(1) Holds a current certificate of approval for lifeguarding from the American Red
Cross, YMCA, or other organization acceptable to the office or the local health
department;
(2) Is present at waterside during the swimming activity; and
(3) Is not included in the required staff/child ratio.
INTENT: A body of water deeper than 4 feet may not be used for a water activity unless at least one properly certified lifeguard is present and on duty.
INSPECTION REPORT ITEM: “Supervision during Water Activities” COMPLIANCE CRITERIA: If water exceeds 4 ft. in depth, a person with current,
approved lifesaving certification is present.
ASSESSMENT METHOD: If possible, observation to verify that a certified lifeguard is present and on-duty; otherwise, interview facility staff to determine if and how proper lifeguard coverage is assured.
Notes:
 Even when a certified lifeguard is present, the operator is responsible for maintaining continued monitoring and appropriate supervision of children during a water activity and while at the body of water.
 See “Playground and Water Safety Guidelines”.
COMAR 13A.16.08 Child Supervision August 29, 2016

COMAR 13A.16.08 Child Supervision
 D. Except during a swimming lesson conducted by a certified water safety organization, such as the American Red Cross, that is acceptable to the office or the local health department, whenever water is over the chest of a child who cannot swim, the child shall receive one-to-one supervision by a staff member who is in the water with the child.
INTENT: Drowning or near-drowning can occur in seconds. For each non- swimming child who is in water over his or her chest, a staff member must also be in the water within arm’s-length reach of the child.
INSPECTION REPORT ITEM: “Supervision during Water Activities” COMPLIANCE CRITERIA: For each non-swimming child in water over his/her
chest, there is a staff member in the water right next to the child.
ASSESSMENT METHOD: If possible, observation to verify that one-on-one in- water supervision is occurring; otherwise, interview facility staff to determine if and how that level of supervision is assured.
Note: See “Playground and Water Safety Guidelines”.
.06 Supervision During Transportation.
When child transportation is conducted to or from:
A. The center by the center operator, there shall be at least one adult other than the driver present in the vehicle if:
(1) More than eight preschoolers are being transported as a group; or
(2) At least one child is being transported and the driver of the vehicle is not:
(a) A center employee; or
(b) The parent of a child in care who is authorized by the operator to assist in
transporting children in care; or
B. An off-site activity by an independent contractor or a local school district and at
least one child in care is being transported, the center operator shall ensure that there is at least one adult other than the driver present in the vehicle.
INTENT: Having to supervise a sizable group of preschoolers alone while driving can easily distract the driver, thus creating a significant safety risk for everyone in the vehicle. Having an additional adult present to supervise the children allows the driver to concentrate fully on driving.
INSPECTION REPORT ITEM: “Supervision During Transportation”
COMPLIANCE CRITERIA: There is at least one additional adult present whenever more than eight (i.e., at least nine) preschoolers are being transported.
COMAR 13A.16.08 Child Supervision August 29, 2016

COMAR 13A.16.08 Child Supervision
 ASSESSMENT METHOD: Review facility records (activity schedule, personnel list, etc.) and interview staff as necessary to determine staff transportation assignments in relation to transportation events involving more than eight preschoolers.
.07 Playground Supervision.
When a group of children is engaged in a playground or outdoor activity, staff members assigned to the group shall:
A. Station themselves among the children so that immediate intervention can occur if necessary; and
INTENT: To maximize safeguards and protection of children while on the playground and during outdoor activities, all children must be supervised at all times.
INSPECTION REPORT ITEM: “Playground Supervision”
COMPLIANCE CRITERIA: During playground and other outdoor activities, staff station themselves among the children so that they can supervise the children and intervene as necessary.
ASSESSMENT METHOD: Observe outdoor activities to determine if staff position themselves in a manner which enables them to be immediately available to intervene as necessary.
Note: See “Playground and Water Safety Guidelines”.
B. If a child expresses or shows signs of discomfort due to over-activity, temperature or weather conditions, or other physical or environmental factors, take immediate and appropriate steps to alleviate the discomfort.
INTENT: To ensure that children who appear to experience discomfort due to outdoor activities and other outdoor factors are immediately attended to and the discomfort is alleviated by staff.
INSPECTION REPORT ITEM: “Playground Supervision”
COMPLIANCE CRITERIA: During playground and other outdoor activities, staff immediately act to alleviate a child’s discomfort due to over-activity, temperature or weather conditions, or other physical or environmental factors.
ASSESSMENT METHOD: Observe outdoor activities to determine if staff immediately act to alleviate a child’s discomfort if a child shows signs of discomfort due to over- activity, temperature or weather conditions, or other physical or environmental factors.

A. During a rest period for a group of children who are younger than 2 years old:
(1) The required staff/child ratio applicable to that group shall be maintained; and
(2) Each staff member assigned to the group shall remain with the children.
B.
INTENT: Because of the vulnerability of infants and toddlers, during naptime or rest periods in classrooms with children who are younger than 2-years-old, the required staff/child ratio may not be relaxed.
INSPECTION REPORT ITEM: “Rest Time Supervision”
COMPLIANCE CRITERIA: During naptime or rest periods in classrooms with children who are younger than 2-years-old or older, the staff/child ratio required by §.03 of this Chapter is in effect.
ASSESSMENT METHOD: Observe staff/child ratios during naptime or rest periods in classrooms with children who are younger than 2-years-old to determine if the staff/child ratios established in §.03 of this Chapter are in effect.

(a) At least one child care teacher or aide assigned to the group shall continue to remain in the room with the children; and
(b) Other staff members, if any, assigned to the group may leave the room but shall remain on the premises and within hearing range.
INTENT: During naptime or rest periods, certain staff/child ratio requirements may be modified with regard to children who are at least 2-years-old.
INSPECTION REPORT ITEM: “Rest Time Supervision”
COMPLIANCE CRITERIA: During naptime or rest periods in classrooms with children who are 2-years-old or older, staff supervision complies with the specifics of the regulation.
ASSESSMENT METHOD: Observe staff/child ratios during naptime or rest periods in classrooms with children who are 2-years-old or older are napping or resting, to determine if at least one child care teacher or aide remains in the room; and, if this is the case, the other staff members assigned to the group remain on the premises within hearing range of the classroom.

 Review center records to determine if a written discipline policy is present.
 Observe to determine if the policy is posted where it can be reviewed by parents, or interview center personnel to determine how it is made available to parents.
 Review the contents of the policy to determine if it is safe, non-harmful, and appropriate for use with all of the developmental levels served by the center.
Note: Maryland law forbids corporal punishment of a child, in any form, by anyone other than the child’s parent or legal guardian. For additional information and guidance on child discipline, see “Discipline Measures”.
.04 Parental Access.
An operator shall permit the parent of a child in care to:
A. Freely observe all areas of the center used for child care during operating hours; and B. Have access to the parent's child at any time during the center's hours of operation, without appointment.
INTENT: Whenever the facility is in operation, parents must have access to their children and to the areas of the facility that are approved for care. The operator is prohibited from requiring parents to give any advance notice of a visit to the facility during operating hours.
INSPECTION REPORT ITEM: “Parental Access”
COMPLIANCE CRITERIA: Without prior notification, parents have free access to their

COMAR 13A.16.07 Child Protection August 29, 2016
 Page 4 of 10

COMAR 13A.16.07 Child Protection
 INTENT: To protect children from harm (and the center from liability), the operator may not release a child to anyone except the child’s parent or legal guardian, an identified person who has been explicitly named by the parent, or an identified Child Protection Services worker.
INSPECTION REPORT ITEM: “Authorized Release”
COMPLIANCE CRITERIA: The center has a policy to ensure that each child is released only to:
 The child’s parent or legal guardian,
 A person identified as being someone authorized by the parent or guardian to pick the child up, as stated on the child‘s “Emergency Form”, OCC 1214, or in a special written authorization for a specific date or situation (see “Notes” below), or
 An identified Child Protection Services worker.
ASSESSMENT METHOD:
Interview center personnel to determine if:
 There is a child release policy,
 Each center staff member and employee is aware of the policy, and
 The policy is followed.
Notes:
 The “Emergency Form”, OCC 1214, is intended to provide the names and
contact information for persons who are routinely authorized to pick the child up if the parent or guardian is unavailable. However, a parent may want to have the child picked up from the center by someone else as part of a special occasion or activity (for example, an out-of-town relative who has arrived for a visit, or a car pool driver for an afterschool sports practice). In this type of situation, the operator may release the child only if:
 The parent has specified in writing who is expected to pick the child up, and when the pick up will occur, or
 The parent cannot pick up the child due to unforeseen circumstances (e.g., parent has an accident, is stuck in traffic, etc.), the specified emergency contacts cannot be reached, and the parent calls the center and provides explicit instructions for an alternate person to retrieve the child; and
COMAR 13A.16.07 Child Protection August 29, 2016
 Page 5 of 10

COMAR 13A.16.07 Child Protection
  Center personnel are able to verify the identity of the person who arrives for the child.
 If a parent or legal guardian who shows signs of being intoxicated, or otherwise impaired, arrives to pick up the child, center personnel do not have the right to deny the person access to the child or to prevent the person from taking the child. However, center personnel do have the right to contact Child Protective Services immediately to express concern about the apparent condition of the person and the possible risk to the child. The following are some other courses of action the operator may wish to consider:
 If the person shows signs of being so intoxicated, or otherwise impaired, that the child would be placed at risk of serious and immediate harm by being released to the person, call the police. If the person poses a threat to center personnel or any of the other children, call the police and request immediate assistance. If possible and prudent, center personnel should try to stall the person until the police arrive.
 If there is another parent or authorized adult noted on the child’s “Emergency Form”, OCC 1214, center personnel may try to contact that person to explain the situation and request the person’s assistance.
 If the person plans to drive the child home, center personnel might suggest using an alternative means of transportation (for example, calling a taxi).
.06 Child Security.
A. The operator shall ensure the safety and security of each child at all times.
INTENT: The operator is fully responsible at all times for the safety, health, and welfare of each child in attendance.
B. Whenever an area of the center is being used for a child care activity and children are present, the operator may not permit the area to be used at the same time for any other purpose without prior approval of the office.
INTENT: An area approved for care may not be used for any purpose other than child care activities if children in attendance are present in that area.
INSPECTION REPORT ITEM: "Child Security"
COMAR 13A.16.07 Child Protection August 29, 2016
Page 6 of 10

COMAR 13A.16.07 Child Protection
 COMPLIANCE CRITERIA: If children are present in an approved care area, the area is used only for child care-related activities.
ASSESSMENT METHOD: Observe each approved area that has children present to determine whether any activity not related to child care is occurring.
C. Unless an employee or staff member has successfully passed federal and State criminal background checks and, if hired on or after October 1, 2005, a review of child abuse and neglect records, the individual may not be alone with an unrelated child in care.
INTENT: Before a facility employee may be left alone with an unrelated child in care, the employee must have successfully completed federal and State criminal background checks and a child and adult abuse/neglect clearance.
INSPECTION REPORT ITEM: "Child Security"
COMPLIANCE CRITERIA: Only employees who have successfully completed both criminal background checks and a child and adult abuse/neglect clearance are alone with children at any time.
ASSESSMENT METHOD: If an employee is observed to be alone with an unrelated child in care, determine if that person has successfully completed the required background checks and clearance.
Note: If a newly hired employee is someone for whom OCC has previously received federal and State criminal background check results (due either to employment at another child care center or to having been a family day care home provider or resident) and those results were "clean," the person may be left alone with children at the current facility pending receipt of results of the federal and State CBC application made in connection with the person's current employment.
D. An employee or staff member who has successfully passed federal and State criminal background checks and, if hired on or after October 1, 2005, a review of child abuse and neglect records shall:
(1) Accompany a child whenever the child is in the presence of another individual, unless the individual is:
(a) Another child in care;
(b) A health service consultant used by the facility operator pursuant to COMAR 13A.16.06.14C;
(c) The child's parent, guardian, or other individual to whom the child may be
released pursuant to Regulation .05 of this chapter;
(d) An individual who is authorized by the child's parent or guardian, and whose
identity is verified, to provide a health care, academic, or other service to the child;
COMAR 13A.16.07 Child Protection August 29, 2016
 Page 7 of 10

COMAR 13A.16.07 Child Protection
 (e) During an off-site activity, another child's parent or guardian, who is designated in writing by the facility operator to assist in transporting children to or from the center; or
(f) If the center is located at a school, an individual who for compensation is employed to work at the school; and
(2) Unless documentation is on file at the center that an independent contractor performing a service at the center has successfully passed federal and State criminal background checks and a review of child abuse and neglect records, remain within sight and sound of the contractor whenever the contractor is in an area where children are present.
INTENT: With certain stated exceptions, a facility employee who has successfully passed federal and State criminal background checks and, if hired on or after October 1, 2005, has had a satisfactory child and adult abuse/neglect clearance, must chaperone a child in care whenever the child is in the presence of a person who is not officially associated with the facility. A similarly screened employee must remain within sight and sound of an outside contractor if that contractor has not passed background checks and clearance and is in an area where children are present.
INSPECTION REPORT ITEM: "Child Security"
COMPLIANCE CRITERIA: Each child is chaperoned as required whenever the child is in the presence of a person who is not associated with the center, unless that person is excepted by regulation.
ASSESSMENT METHOD: If a visitor or other non-excepted outsider is present, observe to determine if each child in that person's presence is chaperoned as required. If observation is not possible, interview the Director and facility staff as needed to determine how and by whom this requirement is met.
Notes:
 A person hired by the parent of a child in care to provide a particular service only to that child is not considered to be an "independent contractor" as defined in Chapter .01 regulation .02B(29). Therefore, the operator is not required to have the person accompanied. The requirement for a staff member to be present during a “third-party” activity is intended only where the activity has been arranged (wholly or in part) at the program or facility level and may be open to participation by other children in care.
 OCC performs child abuse/neglect clearances only for persons who are officially associated with the child care program (i.e., employees, substitutes, residents, etc.). For an independent contractor, the Director must arrange with the local Child Protective Services (CPS) Unit to perform the clearance. For this purpose, the Director will need to request a CPS release of information form (DHR/SSA
COMAR 13A.16.07 Child Protection August 29, 2016
 Page 8 of 10

COMAR 13A.16.07 Child Protection
 1279) from the local department, have the contractor complete the release form, and then submit it directly to the local CPS Unit.
 Maryland's Family Law Article §5-554(e) and (f) prevent an operator from sharing with OCC the specific findings of criminal background check (CBC) reports that the operator has received from CJIS on an independent contractor. In view of this prohibition, OCC can assess compliance with this regulation in one of two ways:
 The Licensing Specialist may request the Director to reveal only enough of the contractor's CBC reports to show the CJIS letterhead, the name of the report subject, and the nature of each report (federal or State). This is sufficient to verify that “documentation exists on file.” As to whether the person has “successfully passed” the background check, the Licensing Specialist may request the Director to give a statement (verbal or written) affirming that assessment. If this statement is given, compliance with the requirement is assessed.
 The Licensing Specialist should request the Director to provide a written (signed and dated) statement saying that (a) the contractor’s federal and State criminal background check results have been received at the facility, and (b) the contractor successfully passed the background check. If this statement is submitted, compliance with the requirement is assessed.
 An outside person hired to do staff training at the center would fall under the definition of independent contractor unless the center is located in a school and the trainer is a school employee. As such, the trainer would have to be "chaperoned" when in the presence of children unless the trainer had completed State and federal CBCs as well as an abuse/neglect clearance.
E. Activity Not Conducted by a Staff Member.
(1) An activity involving the participation of children that is not conducted or led by
a staff member is not permitted unless:
(a) An appropriately qualified staff member is present throughout the activity to
supervise the children; or
(b) The center is located on the premises of a school and the activity is conducted
under school auspices by an individual who for compensation is employed to work at the school.
(2) A child may not participate in the activity unless the center has received prior written permission from the child's parent or guardian for the child's participation.
INTENT: A child activity conducted by a "third-party" person requires the presence of a properly qualified staff member unless the center is located in a school and the "third- party" person is a school employee. A child may not participate in a "third-party" activity without prior written permission from the child's parent.
COMAR 13A.16.07 Child Protection August 29, 2016

COMAR 13A.16.07 Child Protection INSPECTION REPORT ITEM: "Child Security"
COMPLIANCE CRITERIA:
 A qualified staff member is present during each "third-party" activity.
 The center has received written permission from a child's parent before the child
participates in a "third-party" activity. ASSESSMENT METHOD:
 During a "third-party" activity, observe to determine if a qualified staff member is present. If observation is not possible, interview the Director and facility staff as needed to determine which staff members, if any, are present during "third-party" activities.
 Review child records to determine if written parent permissions are present for children who participate in a "third-party" activity.

 COMPLIANCE CRITERIA: The center does not employ any person for whom a criminal background check (CBC) report issued on or after October 1, 2005 reveals a pending charge for, or adjudication on any of the listed offenses.
ASSESSMENT METHOD: Review the center's Employment Record/Personnel List in conjunction with OCC’s copies of CBC reports received since October 1, 2005 to determine if any individual listed has been charged with, or adjudicated (i.e., been convicted, received a probation before judgment, etc.) for one of the enumerated offenses. Initial CBC requests for employee and subsequent “alerts” are used to determine employability.
Note: See “Guidance – Suitability for Employment Process” and “Verifying Staff Employment During Unannounced Inspections”.
B. If, as reported on or after October 1, 2005, an individual has been identified as responsible for child abuse or neglect or received a conviction, a probation before judgment disposition, a not criminally responsible disposition, or a pending charge for the commission or attempted commission of a crime or offense that is not included in §A of this regulation, the office:

 Operators who use cell phones instead of land lines must not have the cell phone’s password protection activated during child care hours. This will ensure
COMAR 13A.16.05 Physical Plant and Equipment August 29, 2016
 Page 14 of 24

COMAR 13A.16.05 Physical Plant and Equipment
 that anyone (including a child) who may have to use the phone in an emergency is able to do so.
 Employee cell phones may not be used. The operator must provide the phone.
 Communication devices must be available for use on the premises of the child care facility, while transporting children and on field trips. Drivers, while transporting children should not operate a motor vehicle while using a mobile telephone or wireless communications device when the vehicle is in motion or a part of traffic, with the exception of use of a navigational system or global positioning system device.
B. In a center with more than two rooms approved for child care, a staff member supervising a group of children in one room shall be able to communicate a request for assistance to a staff member in another room while maintaining continuous supervision of the group.
C. In each room where care is provided to infants or toddlers, there shall be an operable telephone.
INTENT for C: An emergency involving an infant or toddler must be able to be communicated immediately by a staff member without the staff member having to leave the infant/toddler care room.
INSPECTION REPORT ITEM: “Telephone and Communication”

or an operable intercom that is connected to an operable landline telephone.
ASSESSMENT METHOD: Observe each infant/toddler room to determine if the necessary communication equipment is present.
D. The operator shall provide additional telephones or extensions in the center as may be required to:
(1) Summon emergency fire and rescue services promptly; and
(2) Transmit and receive other emergency communications.
INTENT: If the center has only one telephone but is constructed or laid out in a manner that hinders immediate access to the telephone, a facility employee who needs to make or receive an emergency communication may be delayed in doing so. The center must have as many telephones or extensions as necessary to ensure immediate access and prevent any delay.
INSPECTION REPORT ITEM: “Telephone and Communication”
COMAR 13A.16.05 Physical Plant and Equipment August 29, 2016
Page 15 of 24

COMAR 13A.16.05 Physical Plant and Equipment
 COMPLIANCE CRITERIA: There is a sufficient number of telephones and extensions to ensure prompt emergency communication.
ASSESSMENT METHOD: Observe the number and location of the center’s telephone(s) and extension(s) and compare with the center’s physical size and layout to determine if the number of telephone(s) and extension(s) is sufficient.
.11 General Cleanliness and Disposal of Refuse.
A. The entire center, including floors, walls, ceilings, fixtures, furnishings, materials,
and equipment, shall be kept clean and free of infestation.
INTENT: The facility must be kept clean in order to maintain a healthy environment. INSPECTION REPORT ITEM: “General Cleanliness”
COMPLIANCE CRITERIA: All surfaces and equipment clean:
 Floors, walls, ceilings, fixtures, furnishings, and equipment are free of dirt, grime, grease, and spillage.
 Facility areas and rooms are free of accumulated clutter and trash. ASSESSMENT METHOD: Observe all areas of the facility to assess cleanliness.
Notes:
 The operator is expected to follow cleaning procedures and schedules set forth in OCC’s “General Sanitation Guidelines”.
 Routine cleaning of surfaces, materials, and equipment removes dirt or spills that can harbor bacteria; however, some surfaces and items must also be sanitized with a disinfectant because they are especially likely to become contaminated with high levels of bacteria and serve as vehicles for transmitting illness.
 Many commercial disinfectants contain additives such as perfume or dye and may leave a chemical residue. This could be harmful to children with asthma or allergies. For this reason, the Center for Disease Control (CDC) and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommend using a solution of household bleach and water for general sanitizing purposes. A properly mixed bleach-and- water solution is non-toxic and evaporates rapidly without leaving a residue.
 Whenever children are present, bleach solution (or any other approved disinfectant) should be applied by dipping, soaking, or wiping the item or surface with a cloth (but not a sponge, since sponges harbor bacteria and are hard to
COMAR 13A.16.05 Physical Plant and Equipment August 29, 2016
  Page 16 of 24

COMAR 13A.16.05 Physical Plant and Equipment
 clean). Spraying is acceptable only when dipping or soaking is not feasible and wiping with a cloth is likely to spread the contamination – for example, when sanitizing diapering stations and toilets.
 Whenever a disinfectant of any kind is used, there should always be adequate ventilation. This is especially important in confined or enclosed areas such as bathrooms. A child who is asthmatic or sensitive to the disinfectant should be kept away from the immediate area until it can dissipate completely. If this step is not sufficient, the operator or provider should discuss with the child’s parent other alternatives for reasonably accommodating the child’s sensitivity.
 If a product is registered with the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Division for Chemicals and Pesticides, OCC will accept the product. Check the product label to verify that there is an EPA registration number.
B. In a center for fewer than 12 children located in a residence, the requirements of §A of this regulation apply only to space approved for child care.
INTENT: Where the facility is part of a private dwelling, assessment of compliance with cleanliness requirements is limited to areas approved for child care activities.
C. Cleaning may not be conducted while children are present except in emergencies or as clean-up activities that are part of the daily activity program.
INTENT: Since routine cleaning may involve procedures and cleansing agents that may be hazardous to children, routine cleaning must be done when children are not present.
INSPECTION REPORT ITEM: “General Cleanliness” COMPLIANCE CRITERIA:
 Center cleaning is done when children are not present.
 No child is present in an area where routine cleaning is being done.
ASSESSMENT METHOD: If possible, observe to determine if routine cleaning occurs only in areas where children are not present. If observation is not possible, interview facility staff as needed to determine when routine cleaning occurs.
D. Disposal of Refuse.
(1) Each room used for child care shall have a trash container with a disposable
liner.
(2) In each area used for changing diapers, there shall be a separate trash container
reserved for diaper discards that:
(a) Has a disposable liner and tightly fitting lid;
COMAR 13A.16.05 Physical Plant and Equipment August 29, 2016
Page 17 of 24

COMAR 13A.16.05 Physical Plant and Equipment
 (b) Makes the contents of the container inaccessible to children in care. INTENT: Soiled diapers are a source of contamination and a potential health
hazard, so they must be secured from access by children. INSPECTION REPORT ITEM: “General Cleanliness”
COMPLIANCE CRITERIA: Each soiled diaper container has a disposable liner and a childproof lid or cover. Alternatively, if the lid or cover is only snugly fitting but not childproof, the container itself must be made inaccessible to children.
ASSESSMENT METHOD: Observe to determine if each soiled diaper container is lined and if or how its contents are made inaccessible to children.
(3) All trash containers in child care areas shall be emptied when full but at least daily.
INTENT: Indoor trash containers located in child activity areas must be equipped for daily easy and hygienic trash removal.
INSPECTION REPORT ITEM: “General Cleanliness” COMPLIANCE CRITERIA:
 Each indoor trash container is emptied daily.
 There are no full or overflowing trash containers in the child care areas.
ASSESSMENT METHOD: Observe each trash container in the child activity areas to assess level of contents. Interview facility staff as needed to determine if trash containers are emptied daily.
(4) Refuse that is placed outdoors to await collection shall be stored in receptacles that are:
(a) Made of tight, nonabsorbent, easily washable materials;
(b) Covered with tightly fitting lids; and
(c) Washed and treated with disinfectant when necessary to combat odors and
prevent infestation.
INTENT: To help prevent infestation by insects and vermin, outdoor trash containers must fully enclose their contents and be easily cleanable.
INSPECTION REPORT ITEM: “General Cleanliness”
COMAR 13A.16.05 Physical Plant and Equipment August 29, 2016
Page 18 of 24

Notes:
COMAR 13A.16.05 Physical Plant and Equipment
 COMPLIANCE CRITERIA:
 Appropriate receptacles with tight-fitting lids:
 Trash is stored outdoors only in fully enclosing, rigid or semi-rigid containers that are made of metal, plastic, rubber, or a similar impermeable material, and
 Each container has a snugly fitting lid or cover.
 Clean and sanitized:
 Each outdoor trash container is free of spillage and detritus.
 All trash containers are free of infestation by insects and vermin.
ASSESSMENT METHOD:
 Observe outdoor trash containers for suitability and general cleanliness, and to
determine if infestation is present.
 As necessary, interview facility staff to determine if and how containers are cleaned and sanitized.
.12 Outdoor Activity Area.
A. A center shall have an outdoor activity area on the premises of, adjacent to, or near
and safely accessible to the center that provides adequate usable play space for the approved capacity of the center.
INTENT: Children must have an outdoor play area they can use each day that is accessible and large enough to accommodate vigorous play by all children in attendance, and that can be reached easily and without placing any child in danger. The approved outdoor play area must be close enough to the child care center that vehicle transportation is not required.
INSPECTION REPORT ITEM: “Outdoor Activity Area” COMPLIANCE CRITERIA: There is an outdoor playground that is:
 Available for daily use by children in care;
 Safely and easily accessible to the children without using vehicle transportation;
and,
 Large enough to accommodate the play activities of all children in attendance at one time or in shifts.
ASSESSMENT METHOD: Observe the outdoor activity area to assess its accessibility and suitability.
 COMAR 13A.16.05 Physical Plant and Equipment August 29, 2016
Page 19 of 24

COMAR 13A.16.05 Physical Plant and Equipment
  “Accessible” does not mean that the outdoor playground must necessarily be located on facility property.
 “Accessible” means the outdoor playground needs to be adjacent to, or safely accessible to the facility. Examples of situations that satisfy this accessibility requirement include, but are not limited to, a playground maintained by a school that is next door to the facility and a municipal playground that is located at a short distance from the facility but can easily be reached without risk to any child in care.
B. A center for which a notice of intent, filed pursuant to COMAR 13A.16.02.02A(2), is received by the office on or after January 1, 2009, shall have an outdoor activity area that provides at least 75 square feet of usable play space for:
(1) One half of the approved capacity of the center; or
(2) Each child, if the center has an approved capacity of 20 or fewer children.
INTENT: Children should have adequate space for outdoor activities that will minimize accidents and injuries and will provide ample space for young bodies to engage freely in large muscle development activities. Overcrowding of children on a playground is a frequent contributing factor to child injuries; therefore, it is strongly recommended that the playground area provide at least 75 square feet of play area per child in attendance at the playground.
INSPECTION REPORT ITEM: “Outdoor Activity Area”
COMPLIANCE CRITERIA: The center provides at least 75 square feet of usable play space for the maximum number of children who will use the outdoor play area at one time.
ASSESSMENT METHOD:
 Determine the square footage of the outdoor play space by multiplying the length by
the width.
 If the approved center capacity is for 21 or more children, compute square footage as follows:
1. Divide the approved capacity number by 2.
2. Multiply that number by 75 to determine the number of square footage of
outdoor play space required.
3. Compare the resulting number with the square footage of the outdoor play
area to determine if the total square footage of usable play space is at least, or more than the number of square feet required for half of the approved capacity;
*Or apply an automatic variance as follows:
COMAR 13A.16.05 Physical Plant and Equipment August 29, 2016
 Page 20 of 24

COMAR 13A.16.05 Physical Plant and Equipment
 1. Determine the square footage of the outdoor play space by multiplying the length by the width.
2. Multiply that number by 75.
3. Determine the maximum number of children who may use the outdoor play
space at one time.
 If the approved capacity if for 20 or fewer children:
1. Multiply the approved capacity by 75.
2. Compare that number with the square footage of the outdoor play area to
determine if the total square footage of usable play space is at least, or more than the number of square feet required for the approved capacity.
Notes:
 Public school or municipal playgrounds are not required to be measured. They are appropriate for use.
 *Businesses are encouraged to provide child care services to employees on site or near the workplace. Entrepreneurs are encouraged to open child care facilities in business districts to accommodate families who prefer to place their children in child care facilities close to where they work. While commercial real estate may be available to accommodate excellent child care programs, outdoor play space may be minimal. The automatic variance provides relief to operators addressing outdoor play space issues by approving outdoor play space that comply with the intent of regulations assuring that all children in the play space at any one time are afforded 75 square feet of space each. This type of issue is generally faced by operators of facilities located in urban downtown areas.
 When children are taken to the playground/outdoor play space in shifts, the staff/child ratios must be maintained at all times on the playground/outdoor play space and with the remaining children inside of the facility.
C. Usable play space may include only the area and the activity equipment approved for use by children in care.
D. The activity area shall be free from potential hazards to child health or safety. INTENT: Children must have an outdoor play area they can use each day that is safe.
INSPECTION REPORT ITEM: “Outdoor Activity Area”
COMPLIANCE CRITERIA: There is an outdoor playground that is free of potential safety hazards.
COMAR 13A.16.05 Physical Plant and Equipment August 29, 2016
 Page 21 of 24

COMAR 13A.16.05 Physical Plant and Equipment
 ASSESSMENT METHOD: Observe the outdoor activity area, including equipment fall zones, to determine if it is free from potential hazards to the child’s health or safety.
 The Licensing Specialist shall observe the entire playground area for:  Age-appropriate equipment
 Shock-absorbing surfacing
 Determine if the following safety hazards exist:
 Unstable equipment
 Climbing equipment over 7 feet high
 Equipment or building protrusions that could cause injury or catch on
clothing
 Standing, stagnant water
 Broken glass
 Toxic materials (including toxic substances such as pesticides that may
have been applied to playground areas or fall-zone coverings)
 Fence in disrepair, or the lack of fencing or other suitable barrier to
protect children from nearby hazards such as, but not limited to, open bodies of water, construction equipment, or heavy vehicular traffic
 If certain types of hazards (for example, swimming pools, heavy vehicular traffic, cliffs or drop-offs, etc.) are near to the facility's outdoor play area, and the play area is on the premises of the facility, OCC may require the operator to erect a fence or other type of barrier to protect the children from these hazards. For additional information about this topic, see "Barriers to Protect Children from Life-Threatening Safety Hazards".
Note:
 Studies by insurance companies and hospitals have repeatedly shown that playground injuries are among the leading causes of child emergency medical treatments and hospital emergency room admissions. Many of these injuries are attributable to unsafe playground equipment and to the lack of suitable “fall- zones” around swings and climbing devices. See “Playground Safety”, and “Playground and Water Safety Guidelines”.
E. All outdoor activity equipment shall be safe, in good repair, clean, and nontoxic. INTENT: Children must have outdoor play equipment that is safe, maintained in good
repair, clean, and nontoxic.
INSPECTION REPORT ITEM: “Outdoor Activity Area”
COMAR 13A.16.05 Physical Plant and Equipment August 29, 2016

.13 Swimming Facilities.
A. Only swimming facilities meeting applicable local standards of health, sanitation,
and safety may be used.
INTENT: A swimming pool, lake, or body of water may be used by children only if it is approved for swimming by the appropriate local or State government health office or department.
INSPECTION REPORT ITEM: “Swimming Facilities”
COMPLIANCE CRITERIA: The center can either produce evidence that the swimming facility has been duly approved, or can demonstrate that reasonable efforts have been made by the center to verify that approval.
ASSESSMENT METHOD: If the operator maintains an on-site swimming pool for use by children in care, review facility documentation to ascertain if the pool is approved by applicable health officials. If the swimming facility is located off-site (e.g., at the local YMCA, etc.), interview the director/designee to find out if and how the center determined that the swimming facility was duly approved before permitting children in care to use it.
Note: See “Playground and Water Safety Guidelines”.
B. An above-ground swimming pool may not be used for swimming activities.
INTENT: An above-ground pool is not approved for swimming or wading by children in care. The operator may not permit a child in care to use a wading pool (such as a fill- and-drain molded plastic or inflatable pool) that does not have an operable circulation
COMAR 13A.16.05 Physical Plant and Equipment August 29, 2016
  Page 23 of 24

COMAR 13A.16.05 Physical Plant and Equipment
 system approved by the local health department. Stagnant (uncirculated) pool water is a potential health hazard because it contaminates quickly.
INSPECTION REPORT ITEM: “Swimming Facilities”
COMPLIANCE CRITERIA: The center does not use an above-ground swimming pool or a wading pool for swimming or water activities that does not have an operable circulation system approved by the local health department.
ASSESSMENT METHOD: Determine if an above-ground swimming pool, or a wading pool that does not have an operable circulation system that has been approved by the local health department, is used for swimming or water activities by children in care.
Note: See “Playground and Water Safety Guidelines”.

COMAR 13A.16.04 Operational Requirements
 .01 Capacity.
A. An office shall determine the capacity of the center according to criteria established
in:
(1) This subtitle affecting floor space, outdoor activity space, staffing, equipment,
ages of the children to be enrolled, and sanitary facilities; and
(2) Applicable codes, including zoning, building, and fire codes.
INTENT: The purpose of setting maximum capacity is to ensure that the number of children present at any given time does not exceed the facility’s ability to provide adequate supervision and care to each of those children. If maximum capacity is exceeded, the health, safety, or welfare of the children present may be jeopardized. To establish a facility’s maximum capacity, the Regional Office evaluates certain factors, each of which is critical to child health, safety, and welfare.
Notes:
In setting maximum capacity, the Regional Office takes into account the following:
 Consideration is given to any limitations imposed by applicable State or local fire, environmental health, zoning, or other requirements.
 Evaluation of the facility’s physical structure and layout (or an applicant’s plans for the structure and layout) to determine whether the requested child capacity can be safely accommodated. Considerations include, but are not limited to:
 The number and age-ranges of children to be served;
 The number, size, location, and appropriateness of child activity areas
(both indoor and outdoor);
 The type, extent, and suitability of care-related equipment and
furnishings;
 The sufficiency and appropriateness of sanitary facilities.
 Review of the facility personnel lists and staffing patterns to ensure that the facility will be able to meet staff-child ratios and group size requirements for the requested child capacity.
Based on an assessment of the above items, the Licensing Specialist will submit a capacity recommendation to the Licensing Supervisor or Regional Manager. The Supervisor or Manager is responsible for approving or disapproving the capacity recommendation. Before reaching an approval decision, the Supervisor or Manager may need to obtain additional information or conduct a further inspection of the facility to evaluate the appropriateness of the capacity recommendation. Once the decision has been made, the applicant or operator will be promptly notified. If the approved capacity is less than requested, the applicant
COMAR 13A.16.04 Operational Requirements
 August 29, 2016
Page 1 of 3

COMAR 13A.16.04 Operational Requirements
 or operator may appeal the decision to the MSDE Licensing Branch Central Office.
B. An operator shall limit the total number of children in care at one time to the capacity approved by the office.
INTENT: Establishment of maximum capacity is directly based on child health, safety, and welfare considerations. For a given child care area, the operator may not exceed the approved capacity stated on the center license.
INSPECTION REPORT ITEM: “Capacity”
COMPLIANCE CRITERIA: The number of children present does not exceed the
approved capacity for that area as stated on the center license.
ASSESSMENT METHOD: Observe to determine if the number of children present, by age, is within the number stated on the license. If necessary, verify the children’s ages.
Note: If an applicant or operator is seeking approval for evening or overnight care, OCC will consider space, supervision, sleeping facilities, and other safety factors when setting maximum capacity.
.02 Enrollment and Attendance.
A. All children in care at any one time are counted as being in attendance for purposes of complying with the regulations governing capacity, group size, and staff/child ratios.
INTENT: “Capacity” means the maximum number of children that may be physically present in the facility at the same time. “Enrollment” means the total number of children currently served by the facility at any time during its approved operating hours. “Attendance” means the number of children actually present at a given time. A facility’s enrollment may exceed its capacity, but the number of children in attendance at the same time may not exceed the facility’s capacity.
B. An operator may not enroll a child for more than 14 hours in a 24-hour period unless approved in advance by the office.
INTENT: Licensed child care is intended only to provide day-to-day custodial care and supervision of children during the time when their parents are elsewhere. It is expected that each child’s parent or guardian will take the child home at the end of each day. Except as approved in advance by OCC, child care services may not be provided to a child during any given day for more than 14 hours in a 24-hour period.
INSPECTION REPORT ITEM: “Enrollment and Attendance”
COMAR 13A.16.04 Operational Requirements

COMAR 13A.16.04 Operational Requirements
 COMPLIANCE CRITERIA: During any given day, no child is in attendance for more than 14 hours without the prior approval of the Regional Office.
ASSESSMENT METHOD: Review the facility’s daily child attendance records to determine the length of time children are in attendance there. If a child has been in attendance for more than 14 hours, determine if the facility received prior OCC approval.
Note: An exception to the requirement for prior approval may be granted in cases of occasional evening hours or "sleepovers."
C. An operator may not admit an infant who is younger than 6 weeks old. INTENT: A child who has only recently been born is too young to be admitted to a
congregate care setting.
INSPECTION REPORT ITEM: “Enrollment and Attendance”
COMPLIANCE CRITERIA: No child admitted to care is younger than 6 weeks old.
ASSESSMENT METHOD: Review the facility’s child admission records to determine if any child in care is younger than the minimum age.
D. An operator may enroll a child only if the office has given written approval for the facility to care for children of that child's age.
INTENT: A center may not provide care to a child of a given age unless approved by OCC to do so. If granted, this age approval is documented on the license that is issued to the operator. If an age is not specified on the license, the center may not enroll a child of that age.
INSPECTION REPORT ITEM: “Enrollment and Attendance”
COMPLIANCE CRITERIA: The center enrolls and provides care only to children of the
age(s) for which the center is approved, pursuant to the center license.
ASSESSMENT METHOD: Review the facility’s child admission records to determine if any child enrolled in care is of an age for which the facility has not been approved.

COMAR 13A.16.03 Management and Administration
 .01 Multi-Site Centers.
A child care center may have more than one location and may be treated as one center for purposes of this chapter only if:
A. The buildings:
(1) Function as one integrated center, are in close proximity such as across the street
or on the same campus, and are connected by an intercom system; and
(2) Are under the supervision of one director; and
B. Two or more locations:
(1) Are administered by one central administration with one ownership; and
(2) Share common administrative policies and procedures and contracts.
INTENT: When a child care license is issued, it is issued to authorize operation only at a specific location. A licensee may be authorized to operate a number of centers at various locations, but each of these centers must be separately licensed because each is sited at a different location. Most centers are fully contained within a single area or structure; however, a center’s “location” may include two or more separate areas or structures if those areas or structures are in close physical proximity to each other and are operated as a single administrative unit under a single director.
INSPECTION REPORT ITEM: “Multi-Site Centers”
COMPLIANCE CRITERIA: Each different site location or location address of a center has been issued a separate license; however, if the licensee has been authorized to operate two or more separate structures in close physical proximity to each other as a single “location”, only one license is required.
ASSESSMENT METHOD: Review the address locations of the center operations to determine:
 If the multi-site center operates at different location addresses and holds a separate license for each site location.
 Verify if the licensee has been authorized to operate separate areas or structures of the center as a single “location” and holds a single license for such an operation.
.02 Admission to Care.
A. An operator may not admit a child for care unless the operator has:
(1) Met the applicable requirements of this regulation; and
(2) Received the written records required by Regulation .04C—H of this chapter,
unless the child is temporarily admitted or retained in care on a temporary basis pursuant to §F of this regulation.
COMAR 13A.16.03 Management and Administration

Page 1 of 32

COMAR 13A.16.03 Management and Administration
 INTENT: A child may not begin care until the center has received a medical evaluation, immunization certificate (immunization record), and emergency information for the child.
INSPECTION REPORT ITEM: “Admission to Care” COMPLIANCE CRITERIA:
 On or before the first day that the child begins care, the center has received the following items signed by the child’s parent or guardian and, if indicated, by a licensed health practitioner:
 “Emergency Form”, OCC form 1214
 “Health Inventory”, OCC form 1215 (or equivalent form which
contains all information as required on the Health Inventory)
 “Immunization Certificate” (record), DHMH form 896
ASSESSMENT METHOD: Review of children’s files to determine if the child’s file contains a completed Emergency Form, Health Inventory, and Immunization Certificate (immunization record).
Notes:
 When documents required for admission to care have not been received, inform the operator or Director that the parent must be told that the child may not return to the center until all required documents are received. Do not send the child home.
 While verification of “Lead Screening” is a part of the Health Inventory, the parent has 30 days after admission to get it completed.
 See the current DHMH “Age-Appropriate Immunization Chart” schedule.
Federal law under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) prohibits child care programs from denying admission to a child with a disability solely on the basis of that disability. For more information on the applicability of ADA requirements to child care programs, see “Child Care and the A.D.A.”
B. At or before the child's admission to care, the operator shall obtain written information from the parent about the child's individual needs.
INTENT: Before caring for a child, center staff must know the individual needs of a child. In order for this information to be specific to each child, the information about each child must be provided in writing by the parent. This information must be maintained by the center for the purpose of easy reference by center staff.

   August 29, 2016
Page 2 of 32

COMAR 13A.16.03 Management and Administration INSPECTION REPORT ITEM: “Admission to Care”
COMPLIANCE CRITERIA: There is a written statement from the parent about each child’s individual needs that is maintained by the center. Documentation indicates that center personnel and the child’s parent have discussed any particular needs the child may have so that the program can be prepared to address those needs. This discussion must occur on or before the first day that child begins in care.
Note: Documentation may be in any format, but it must include, at a minimum:
 The date of the discussion;
 The specific nature of the child’s individual needs, if any, identified by the

(1) Enrollment, with each child's name, address, telephone number, date of birth,
and dates and time periods for which enrolled; and
(2) Attendance, by groups of children, which indicate:
(a) The dates of attendance of each child in the center; and
(b) Verification by each child's parent of that child's recorded daily attendance
in care; and
INTENT: The facility must maintain enrollment and attendance records for all children enrolled to enable OCC to assess compliance with regulatory requirements pertinent to facility capacity, staff/child ratios, and group size. Parental verification of attendance provides proof that the child was in attendance on any particular day.

care.
ASSESSMENT METHOD: Review center records to determine if there is a written record for each child in care.
Notes:
 Compliance with requirements of this regulation is further assessed at §§ B-J, as applicable.
 Certain information or forms, i.e., Emergency Card, Health Inventory, Parental Permission Slips, etc., required for each child may be found in the child’s individual file or may be consolidated in a centrally located file.
 For information not found in the child’s individual record, ask Operator or Director if required information is housed elsewhere within the facility.
 Reviewing Child Records: Child Care Centers are generally approved to serve large numbers of children. It is extremely time-consuming for licensing staff to inspect large numbers of child records during an inspection given the complexity and amount of information required to be checked for each record. To decrease time spent in this area, while ensuring that the provider maintains appropriate child records, Licensing Specialists may proceed as follows:
 Randomly select 10 child records, creating a mixture of all infant and toddler records with some preschooler records, and review for compliance with the following:
 §.04 of this Chapter, Child Records, A.–K., as applicable;  Chapter .09, §.02 Activity Plans; and,
 Chapter .12, §.06 Infant Feeding, as applicable.
 When a noncompliant record is reviewed, cite the noncompliance on the inspection form (be sure to use the canned comment) and cease inspecting child records.
 Inform the Director that a noncompliance was found; therefore, all child records must be checked for completeness and accuracy. (You may note this directive in the additional comment section.)
COMAR 13A.16.03 Management and Administration

COMAR 13A.16.03 Management and Administration
 B.
 Ask the Director to contact you when all child records are compliant with regulations.
 Inform the Director that upon your return, you will randomly select another 10 child records to check.
 If all records checked in this random selection are compliant, the child record noncompliance will be noted as corrected.
 If non-compliances are found, the “N” will stand as cited until the Licensing Specialist finds no non-compliances during the random sampling review of child records.
 Licensing Specialist must discuss further follow-up with the Supervisor
Each child's written records shall be:

 COMPLIANCE CRITERIA: Each child in care younger than 6 years old has received appropriate lead screening.
ASSESSMENT METHOD: Review children’s files to determine if and when the center received the required documentation.
Notes:
 Three, four and five year old children who are enrolled in public or nonpublic school are considered school-age children. If the child attends a school-age program located in the child’s school, the assumption is that documentation of lead screening would be on site in the school’s file.
 The child’s parent is responsible for making sure the child has received a lead screening.
 The child’s physician is responsible for ensuring that the child received the appropriate lead screening.
 If a child has been tested but the health practitioner does not have the test date, the local health department in the jurisdiction where the child lives can help the child’s parent get a record of the test results.
 The zip codes of the at-risk areas that require blood lead testing are listed on the back of the Health Inventory form. When a child registers to begin school, the Form 1215 will meet the requirements for school entry. For this reason, parents should be encouraged to keep a copy of the form for school registration purposes.
F. A medical evaluation and, if applicable, documentation of an appropriate lead screening that are transferred directly from a registered family child care home, another licensed child care center, or a public or nonpublic school in Maryland may be accepted as meeting the requirements of §§D(3) and E of this regulation.

INTENT:
 To minimize health risks to children, the center must obtain and maintain an immunization record for each enrolled child which demonstrates that each child has had immunizations appropriate for the child’s age per the guidelines of the Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DHMH).
 To minimize the possibility of an adverse reaction to an immunization to occur while the child is in care at the center, the child must have had at least one dose of each vaccine appropriate for the child’s age before entry into the center and the date of dosage must be recorded on the immunization record.
INSPECTION REPORT ITEMS: “Child Records”
COMPLIANCE CRITERIA: Children’s files contain an immunization record that
complies with (1) – (4), as applicable, of this regulation.
ASSESSMENT METHOD: Review children’s files to determine if the files contain immunization documentation.

Since inspections are unannounced, staff records may not be on site upon arrival of the licensing specialist. In those instances, the Operator must be given the opportunity to get the records to the site before the inspection is completed.
 Some Operators keep staff records locked in a confidential file at all times. When an operator is not available during an unannounced inspection and the person in charge does not have access to the locked records, schedule a follow-up visit (the next business day) to review the records.
 Some operators keep staff records in a computerized system which is acceptable. The operator shall:
A. Maintain and, upon request by the office, submit a current and complete list of personnel, on a form supplied or approved by the office, that includes each individual, whether paid or unpaid, who works at the center on a routine basis;
INTENT: To help ensure the safety of children in care, the operator must maintain a current and complete list of all facility employees and must make that list available to OCC.
INSPECTION REPORT ITEM: "Staff Records"
COMPLIANCE CRITERIA: A current and complete Employment Record is maintained which lists all current personnel and is provided to the Regional Office upon request. OCC Form 1203 Personnel List/Change Form is used for this purpose.
ASSESSMENT METHOD: Review the facility files to determine if a current and complete Employment Record is present and compare with OCC 1203 Personnel
COMAR 13A.16.03 Management and Administration

COMAR 13A.16.03 Management and Administration
 List/Change Form or an alternative form approved by the Office, and the CCATS Associated Party list for that facility.
Notes:
 Child care centers may maintain a computerized version of the employment record and may submit to OCC as an alternative to OCC 2013 Personnel List/Change Form. The computerized format must contain all elements noted on the OCC 1203.
 On a routine basis, a center's Employment Record is reviewed by the Regional Office in conjunction with each unannounced inspection of the facility in accordance with policy, “Verifying Staff Employment in Child Care Facilities During Annual Unannounced Inspections”.
 The Employment Record is subject to review by the Regional Office at other times as well (for example, in connection with a complaint investigation).
 The Regional Office may request the center to submit the current Employment Record in advance of an unannounced inspection.
 If the Employment Record is not reviewed in advance, it will be reviewed on-site during the inspection.
B. For review by the office and by parents who have enrolled their children or are considering enrolling their children, post in a conspicuous location a current and complete staffing pattern, on a form supplied or approved by the office, that specifies:
(1) The number and ages of children enrolled;
(2) The staff/child ratio in relation to the daily schedule; and
(3) By staff name, all child care assignments;
INTENT: So that OCC, parents/guardians of children in care, and visitors may verify that the center is complying with staff/child ratio and maximum group size requirements, the operator must post current and complete staffing pattern form(s).
INSPECTION REPORT ITEM: “Staffing Pattern Posted”
COMPLIANCE CRITERIA: A current and complete Staffing Pattern form, either OCC 1206, or an alternative form that has been approved by the Regional Office is posted for each child activity room.
COMAR 13A.16.03 Management and Administration
 August 29, 2016
Page 20 of 32

COMAR 13A.16.03 Management and Administration ASSESSMENT METHOD:
 Observe to determine if all necessary staffing pattern forms are posted in a conspicuous location in the center.
 Review each form for currency and completeness.
Notes:
 A center must post its current staffing patterns in a conspicuous location in the center. The staffing patterns do not have to be posted in each classroom. Collective posting at a single location (for example, on a main bulletin board) is acceptable.
 On a routine basis, a center's Employment Record is reviewed by the Regional Office in conjunction with each unannounced inspection of the facility.
 The Employment Record is also subject to review by the Regional Office at other times (for example, in connection with a complaint).
 The Licensing Specialist should be careful to link review of the staffing patterns to review of the Employment Record to ensure that properly trained staff are providing required coverage at all times.
C. During an individual's employment at the center and for 2 years after the date of the individual's last employment there, maintain a record for each individual that includes:
(1) The individual's:
(a) Training, if required under this chapter;
(b) Experience, if required under this chapter; and
(c) Function or position;
(2) Verification that the staff member's age complies with the minimum required for the position held;
(3) An employment medical evaluation;
(4) Criminal background check results, except that the operator shall destroy the
record of those results immediately after the last day of the individual’s
employment; and
(5) The date on which the staff member received the written information required
by COMAR 13A.16.06.02;
INTENT: During the employment of each person, the operator must maintain a record of the person’s employment medical evaluation, job qualifications and duties, training completed while employed, federal and State criminal background check results, and
COMAR 13A.16.03 Management and Administration
  August 29, 2016
Page 21 of 32

COMAR 13A.16.03 Management and Administration
 date when the required staff orientation was received. This record must be maintained for 2 years after the person is no longer employed.
INSPECTION REPORT ITEM: "Staff Records"
COMPLIANCE CRITERIA: A record containing the required information is
maintained for:
 Each current employee; and
 Each ex-employee for two years after the end of the person’s employment. ASSESSMENT METHOD: Review the records of current employees and ex-employees
to determine if compliance criteria are met.
Notes:
 Due to the confidentiality requirements for CBCs, copies of the criminal background results should not be in the employee’s record for OCC review.
 The process found in “Checking Staff Continued Training in Child Care Centers Guidelines” may also be used to check staff records for compliance with this regulation.
D. Maintain documentation required for:
(1) Substitutes, pursuant to COMAR 13A.16.06.13; and
(2) The adult available for emergencies, pursuant to COMAR 13A.16.08.02D(3);
and
E. Maintain a calendar or other written record of the:
(1) Days on which a substitute provides care; and
(2) Staff member in whose place the substitute worked.
INTENT: In order that the Regional Office can assess the center's compliance with requirements regarding the use of substitutes, pursuant to Chapter .06, Regulation .13, the center must maintain a written record of the days each substitute provided care to enrolled children and identify the staff member for whom the substitute worked.
INSPECTION REPORT ITEM: "Staff Records"
COMPLIANCE CRITERIA: For each substitute used by the center, there is a record of all of the dates the substitute was used and the name and job title of the person(s) the substitute replaced.
ASSESSMENT METHOD: Review the facility files for each substitute used by the facility to determine if the required records are present.

 .06 Notifications. The operator shall:
A. Within 5 working days of its occurrence, provide written notification to the office about the:
(1) Addition of a new employee or staff member that includes:
(a) The individual’s full name, date of birth, and date of hire;
(b) Information about the individual's work assignment; and
(c) Signed and notarized permission to examine records of abuse and neglect of
children and adults for information about the individual; and
INTENT: To enable OCC to determine if each new employee or staff member meets all applicable requirements of Chapter .06 of these regulations, the operator must provide OCC with certain hiring-related documentation at the earliest possible time.
INSPECTION REPORT ITEM: “Notification of New Employee”
COMPLIANCE CRITERIA: Within 5 business days after a new employee’s start date, the operator provides the Regional Office with a completed “Child Care Facility Personnel List/Staff Change Form”, OCC 1203.
ASSESSMENT METHOD: Review the facility’s current Employment Record to identify recent hires. If there have been recent hires, review the facility’s licensing file to determine if a “Child Care Facility Personnel List/Staff Change Form” form), and a completed “Release of Information” form OCC 1260, have been received as required for each new hire.
Note: To curtail unnecessary CJIS Alerts, request the Operator or Director to inform the office of individuals no longer employed at the facility, or who were never employed after getting CBCs. The “Child Care Facility Personnel List Staff Change Form” may be used for this purpose.
(2) Ending of employment, for whatever reason, of an individual that includes the:
(a) Individual’s full name; and
(b) Date of the individual’s last day of employment.
Note: OCC 1203 Personnel List/Staff Change Form is used for reporting purposes.
B. Within 15 working days of adding the new employee or staff member, provide to the office:
(1) If applicable, documentation that the individual meets the requirements of this chapter for the assignment, unless documentation already is on file in the office; and
COMAR 13A.16.03 Management and Administration
  August 29, 2016
Page 23 of 32

COMAR 13A.16.03 Management and Administration
 (2) If the individual is paid by the center operator, proof of compliance with the laws and regulations pertaining to criminal background checks;
INTENT: To ensure that new employees are qualified for the positions for which they were hired, and that those individuals are in compliance with criminal background check laws and regulations.
INSPECTION REPORT ITEM: “Notification of New Employee”
COMPLIANCE CRITERIA: As applicable, within 15 business days after a new employee’s start date, the operator provides the Regional Office with documentation that the individual meets the regulatory requirements, if any, for the individual’s job assignment. [NOTE: This documentation need not be submitted to OCC if the individual is identified in the Child Care Automated Tracking System (CCATS) as an associated party for another child care facility in the same position].
Notes:
 All new facility employees must apply to CJIS for a State and FBI record check. If, however, a new employee has previously had a State and FBI record check done and OCC has received the results from CJIS, the person is “known” to OCC and may begin child care duties before the results of the new record check application are returned (i.e., the new employee need not be “chaperoned” pending receipt of the new CBC application results).
 In the case of a multi-site operator, if an employee transfers from one site to another, a new record check application is not required. Since the person's employer remains the same regardless of the person's actual job site location, the person is not considered to be a new employee; therefore, the background check requirements for new employees do not apply.
 CJIS “365-Day Requests”:
 If a new employee's previous employer was a child care facility, school,
adoption or foster care agency, children's recreation center, or similar program or service for children, and if CJIS received a Maryland State and FBI record check request on that person from the previous employer within the year, the person's current employer may file a "365-Day Request" with CJIS.
 The 365-day request is made by submitting a special CJIS form, authorizing CJIS to send the results of that previous record check to the new employer and to the appropriate OCC Regional Office.
 Results are usually received by the new employer and the Regional Office within 3-4 days after a properly completed request reaches CJIS.
COMAR 13A.16.03 Management and Administration
  August 29, 2016
Page 24 of 32

COMAR 13A.16.03 Management and Administration
  Facility operators may obtain copies of the 365-Day Request form and instructions for completing the form by calling CJIS Customer Service at (410) 764-4501.
 There is no fee for filing a 365-Day Request form.
 The operator must submit two copies of the special 365-Day Request form to
CJIS. One copy should include the operator's authorization number, and the other copy should include the appropriate Regional Office's authorization number. Without these authorization numbers, CJIS will not know where to send the record check results.
 The operator should photocopy the completed request form and forward the photocopy to the OCC Regional Office as proof that the 365-Day Request has been submitted.
 State and FBI record check results received on the basis of a 365-Day Request will be accepted by OCC in lieu of a brand-new criminal background check application. If, however, CJIS rejects the 365-Day Request for any reason, the new employee will have to submit a new criminal background check application.
 Whenever submitting a criminal background check (CBC) request for a center employee, the operator must include the appropriate OCC Regional Office authorization number on the CBC request form. The following is a list of the Regional Office authorization numbers:
 Authorization Number 1100000016
   1100000020

INTENT: The operator must notify parents of any injuries or accidents involving their children so that they can seek proper medical attention as necessary. Serious injuries must be reported immediately. Non-serious injuries must be reported within the same day.
INSPECTION REPORT ITEM: “Notifications” COMPLIANCE CRITERIA: The operator notifies the parent:
 Immediately, if the injury or accident is serious, or
 By the end of the same day, if the injury or accident is not serious. ASSESSMENT METHOD: Review children’s files to determine whether, for each noted
injury, there is documentation of if and when parental notification occurred. Note: See “Accident/Injury Record” form.
E. Immediately notify the office of:
(1) An employee who is under investigation for:
(a) A criminal charge; or

 .07 Change of Operation.
A. Except when converting the child care center to a summer youth camp, if an operator wishes to make any changes from the current license, such as use of rooms not previously approved for child care, capacity, hours of operation, age groups served, or the introduction of food service, the operator shall request and receive written approval of the change from the office before implementing the change.
INTENT: Under Maryland law, only the Office of Child Care may modify the terms or conditions of a center license.
INSPECTION REPORT ITEM: "Change of Operation"
COMPLIANCE CRITERIA: Except for conversion to a summer camp, the operator has
received written approval of that change from the Regional Office before implementation.
ASSESSMENT METHOD: Through observation and, if necessary, review of facility records, determine if any unreported change has occurred pertinent to the facility, facility operations, or the number or ages of children served that affects the status or scope of the license.
Notes:
 If an operator wishes to expand the approved operating hours to include evening or overnight care, certain additional information must be provided to OCC before approval will be considered.
 When the use of an alternative site for child care is requested because of an emergency environmental situation (such as environmental hazard, structural damage, eviction, etc.) in a child care center, the following procedures will be used:
 The Licensing Specialist shall:
 Conduct an on-site inspection of the alternative site,
 Check the square footage and the number of toilets, hand sinks, and
drinking facilities.
 If the alternative site is not in full compliance, the OCC Regional
Manager will make a decision as to the health and safety risks to the children and the length of time the center is expected to be at the location.
 Request a fire inspection and, if applicable, a sanitation inspection,
 Contact the local zoning board to ascertain appropriateness of the site for use
 Staff/child ratios and group size must be in compliance.
COMAR 13A.16.03 Management and Administration
  August 29, 2016
Page 29 of 32

COMAR 13A.16.03 Management and Administration
  Rooms should be structured to accommodate individual groups of children to the extent possible (i.e., program, materials, and equipment).
 If the Regional Manager approves use of the site, a letter of authorization shall be issued to the operator. That letter must be posted conspicuously in the site’s approved child care area.
 The plan for using the alternative site shall be evaluated periodically.
 The operator must send a letter to parents notifying them that the licensed
center is temporarily closing during the emergency. In addition, the operator must post a notice at the licensed center notifying the public that the center is temporarily closed.
 The Licensing Specialist shall recommend to the operator that an opportunity be provided for parents and children to make a preliminary visit to the alternative site.
Note: See “Change of Operation” form.
B. After determining whether the proposed change meets the requirements of this subtitle, the office shall approve or disapprove the proposed change. If the change is approved, the office shall issue a revised license indicating the change.
INTENT: Whenever the terms or conditions of a license are modified, the license must be re-issued.
C. If an operator wishes to convert to a summer youth camp, the operator shall:
(1) Notify the office before implementing the change to a summer youth camp;
(2) Upon request by the office, provide proof to the office of the center's certification
as a summer youth camp under Health-General Article, Title 14, Subtitle 4,
Annotated Code of Maryland;
(3) Remove the child care center license from display on the premises used for
operating a summer youth camp during the period of summer youth camp
operation; and
(4) Notify parents of children in care and those applying for care that:
(a) A child care center is not being operated during summer months; and
(b) State regulations for camps differ from those for child care centers.
INTENT: A facility is not permitted to operate simultaneously as a child care center and a summer youth camp – at a given time. It may operate only as one or the other. The Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DHMH) has sole jurisdiction over the certification and regulation of summer youth camps. Application to DHMH for summer youth camp certification is at the facility operator’s discretion. If an operator wishes to operate a summer youth camp, the operator must notify the OCC Regional Office before starting to operate as a camp and must tell parents that the facility will be
COMAR 13A.16.03 Management and Administration

Page 30 of 32

COMAR 13A.16.03 Management and Administration
 operating as a camp under the requirements of DHMH, and not as a child care center under the requirements of OCC.
INSPECTION REPORT ITEM: “Change of Operation”
COMPLIANCE CRITERIA: The operator has informed OCC and DHMH of the change
of operation from a child care center to a summer youth camp.
ASSESSMENT METHOD: Review office file of the operator to determine if the operator has informed OCC of the change in operation from a child care center to a summer youth camp.
.08 Variances.
A. An office may grant a variance to a regulation under this subtitle:
(1) If the safeguards to a child's health, safety, or well-being are not diminished;
(2) When the operator presents clear and convincing evidence that the regulation is
met by an alternative which complies with the intent of the regulation; and
(3) For a limited period of time as specified by the office, or for as long as the license
remains in effect and the operator continues to comply with the terms of the variance.
INTENT: To permit an applicant or operator who cannot reasonably meet a regulation’s literal requirements, to meet the intent of the regulation in an alternative way that protects the health, safety, or well-being of each child in care.
Notes:
 Under Maryland law, the Office of Child Care does not have authority to grant an
exemption from any regulation.
 All center licensing regulations exist primarily to protect the health, safety, and welfare of each child in care; therefore, OCC will only grant a variance if doing so will not diminish that protection.
 A variance is an acceptable way of meeting the intent of a regulation without meeting the regulation’s literal requirements.
 To request a variance, the applicant or operator must submit a completed “Variance Request” form OCC 1213, along with any relevant supporting documentation, to the Regional Office.
 In making the request, the applicant or operator must propose an alternative and demonstrate how that alternative will fully satisfy the regulation’s intent.
COMAR 13A.16.03 Management and Administration
 August 29, 2016
Page 31 of 32

COMAR 13A.16.03 Management and Administration
  Each variance is granted only under certain conditions, and the applicant or operator must continue to meet those conditions.
 If the variance is granted, it has the same force and effect as the regulation, and the applicant or operator must comply fully with all of its terms and conditions.
INSPECTION REPORT ITEM: “Variances”
COMPLIANCE CRITERIA: The applicant or operator has followed procedures for requesting a variance to a regulation, if applicable, and the variance has been granted by the office.
ASSESSMENT METHOD:
 Before inspecting the facility, the Licensing Specialist reviews the facility file to
see if a variance is in effect and, if so, what its nature and duration are.
 If a variance is in effect at the time of a routine licensing inspection, the Licensing Specialist assesses compliance with the terms of the variance.
B. Within 30 calendar days of receiving a completed request for a variance, the office shall notify the operator that the variance has been granted or denied.
C. If a variance request is denied by a regional office of the Agency:
(1) The operator may appeal the denial to the Agency's central office; and
(2) The Agency's central office has the final determination of whether or not a
variance is granted.
D. A variance to sanitary facility requirements that is granted pursuant to COMAR
13A.16.05.08C does not apply to any subsequent additions or enlargements to the center.
