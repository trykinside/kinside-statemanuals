Title 15: Mississippi State Department of Health Part 11: Bureau of Child Care Facilities Subpart 55: Child Care Facilities Licensure
CHAPTER 2: REGULATIONS GOVERNING LICENSURE OF CHILD CARE FACILITIES FOR 12 OR FEWER CHILDREN IN THE OPERATOR’S HOME
Subchapter 1. GENERAL
Rule 2.1.1 Legal Authority: The "Mississippi Child Care Licensing Law," Section 43-20-1 et seq. of the Mississippi Code of 1972 provides the legal authority under which the Mississippi State Department of Health prescribes minimum regulations for child care facilities defined under the law.
Source: Miss. Code Ann. §43-20-8.
Rule 2.1.2

4.
Purpose:
The purpose of these regulations is to protect and promote the health and safety of children in this state by providing for the licensing of child care facilities as defined herein to assure that certain minimum standards are maintained in such facilities. This policy is predicated upon the fact that a child is not capable of protecting himself, and when his parents for any reason have relinquished his care to others, there arises the probability of exposure of that child to certain risks to his health and safety that require the offsetting statutory protection of licensing. This document and its appendices constitute the Regulations Governing the Licensure of Child Care Facilities.
A child care facility may exceed the minimum quality standards required in these regulations, but may not operate without meeting the minimum standards set forth in these regulations.
The maximum capacity of a child care facility is determined by the indoor square footage, kitchen square footage, outdoor playground area, and the number of toilets, urinals, and hand washing lavatories, with the lowest capacity determination being controlling. The maximum capacity of each room that is utilized by the children in a child care facility is calculated individually and may not be exceeded except when provided in these regulations.
A child care facility is subject to inspection at anytime at the discretion of the licensing agency.

Source: Miss. Code Ann. §43-20-8.
Rule 2.1.3 Severability: If any provision of these regulations or the application thereof to any persons or circumstances shall be held invalid, such invalidity shall not affect the provisions or application of these regulations that can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to this end, the provisions of these regulations are declared severable.

The temporary license will reflect the date of issuance of the license, the expiration date, and the number of children for which the facility is licensed. The license issue date is the actual date documentation is received and approval for initial temporary license is granted; the expiration date is the last day of the sixth month following the issue date; examples: January 01 through June 30 or January 15 through June 30.
NOTE: Before a Temporary License is issued and the facility allowed to begin operation the following items must be submitted to and/or verified by the licensing authority, i.e., Mississippi State Department of Health:
a. License Application and $100.00 application fee.
b. License fee - the amount of fee is determined by the licensed capacity of the facility.
c. Documentation that the facility has a qualified director for the child care program that meets the standards set forth in Rule 2.5.3.

APPENDIX - C
NUTRITIONAL STANDARDS

THIS PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK

Introduction
APPENDIX C Nutritional Standards
Meals shall meet the nutritional standards as prescribed in this section. A child care facility shall provide adequate and nutritious meals prepared in a safe and sanitary manner.
Healthy diets help children grow, develop, and perform well in learning environments. Healthy diets contain the amounts of essential nutrients and calories needed to prevent nutritional deficiencies while preventing an excess amount of discretionary calories. Planned meals and snacks provide the right balance of carbohydrate, fat, and protein to reduce risks of chronic diseases, and are part of a full and productive lifestyle. Such diets are obtained from a variety of foods.
Nutrition and feeding practices for children strongly affect the development and long-term health of the child. Proper nutritional care during the early years is essential for intellectual, social, emotional, and physical growth. It is also necessary that an environment be provided which encourages the development of good food habits.
Meals and vending services shall meet the standards from the Offices of Healthy Schools and Child Nutrition for the Mississippi State Department of Education as well as USDA Food and Nutrition Service guidelines.
THE GOALS OF A CHILD CARE FACILITY IN RELATION TO NUTRITION SHALL BE:
1. Menus shall be nutritionally adequate and consistent with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans.
2. Foods shall be provided in quantities and meal patterns that balance energy and nutrients with children’s ages, appetites, activity levels, special needs, and cultural and ethnic differences in food habits.
3. Parents shall be involved in the nutrition component of their child-care facility.
4. A variety of fruits, vegetables, and whole-grain products shall be offered to children for meals and snacks. Mealtime should be used as an opportunity to teach nutrition and/or
food concepts.
5. The addition of fat, sugar, and sources of sodium shall be minimal in food preparation and
service.
6. Food preparation and service shall be consistent with best practices for food safety and
sanitation.
7. Furniture and eating utensils shall be age-appropriate and developmentally suitable to
encourage children to accept and enjoy mealtime.
8. Child-care personnel shall encourage positive experiences with food and eating.
9. Caregivers shall receive appropriate training in nutrition, food preparation, and food
service.

10. Child-care facilities shall obtain assistance as needed from the Child Care Licensure Division and the supportive staff.
11. Nutrition education for children and for their parents shall be encouraged as a component of the child-care program.
12. Child-care programs must comply with local and state regulations related to wholesomeness of food, food preparation facilities, food safety, and sanitation.
13. Family style dining is encouraged.
Based upon the American Dietetic Association Benchmarks for Nutrition Programs in Child-Care Settings
FEEDING SCHEDULE FOR INFANTS AND CHILDREN ONE YEAR AND OLDER
1. Children's food needs are based on the amount of time spent in the child care facility.
2. Any child in a child care facility at the time of service of a meal or snack will be served that meal or snack
3. Child care facilities that are open 24 hours are required to serve three meals and three snacks.
I. Meal Time
Meals and snacks shall be served at regularly scheduled times each day.
The same meal or snack shall not be served more than one time in any 24-hour (one-day) period.
No more than four and no less than a two and one-half hour period must elapse between the beginning of a meal and a snack.
If breakfast is not served, then a mid-morning snack shall be provided.
Since not all children arrive at the facility at the same time, certain parental options regarding breakfast will be allowed as follows:
1. Parent can feed the child prior to arrival at the child care facility.
2. The parent may have the meal provided by the child care facility.
Note: Either option above must be documented and included in the child's record.
     IF YOU ARE OPEN
   YOU MUST SERVE
     Nine hours or less
 Two snacks and one meal
     OR
   One snack and two meals
     Over nine hours
    Two snacks and two meals
      OR
      Three snacks and one meal
    24 hours or during all meals
    Three meal and three snacks: one snack should be a late night snack only served to children who are awake.

Outside foods shall not be brought into the facility, with the exception of special dietary needs. Exempt facilities are facilities that operate less than six hours and as noted in the regulations, otherwise noted in other sections of the standards. Any outside foods shall meet the Office of Healthy School and MSDH Nutrition Standard guidelines.
II. Meal Time Environment
Age appropriate utensils, plates, bowls, cups, and dining area shall be provided.
Children shall not wait longer than fifteen minutes at the table for food to be served. Sufficient time shall be allowed for children to wash their hands and prepare for the meal.
Mealtime shall be used for socialization, and shall be a relaxed, happy time for the children. No media, e.g., televisions, videos, or DVD’s may be viewed during meal and snack times. Family style dining is encouraged with serving platters, bowls, and pitchers on the table so that all present can serve him/her self. Children are encouraged to assist with table setting and bowling up fruits for dessert. All foods served must meet the serving guidelines, and be age appropriate. “Seconds” of foods can be served as indicated at the request of the child or by hunger cues.
A caregiver shall sit and join the children while they are eating. When caregivers are allowed to eat with the children, which is encouraged, staff will eat items that meet nutrition standards. It is suggested that the staff eat the same food items that are served to the children. The staff will encourage social interaction, conversation, and use the mealtime for education purposes. Extra assistance and time shall be provided for slow eaters.
Caregivers shall not eat foods outside of the foods served in the facility in front of the children.
Food shall not be used as a reward or punishment. Children will not be encouraged to “clean your plate,” but encouraging children to try two bites of each food served is acceptable.
Additional servings shall be provided for the child who requests more food at a meal or snack. It is at the discretion of the facility and knowledge of the child’s eating pattern to allow seconds on food items. This time to teach children on portion control, monitoring extra intake, and better food selections is higher in nutritional value.
Meals and snacks provided by a parent must not be shared with other children, unless a parent is providing baked goods for a celebration or party being held at the operation. Foods for a party or celebration shall meet the Office of Healthy School guidelines.
Children will be permitted in meal preparation areas when under the direct supervision of a staff person, when there is no danger of injury from equipment, and for instruction/teaching purposes only.

III. Menus
A complete two-week cycle of menu plans shall be submitted annually to Child Care Licensure as part of the renewal process. Although a minimum complete, two-week cycle menu is required to be submitted annually, child care facilities at their discretion may submit a 4 to 8 week cycle of menu plans.
Daily menus for all meals and snacks prepared and/or served in the child care facility shall be plainly posted. Any substitution shall be of comparable food value and shall be recorded on the menu and dated.
Menus shall be written at least one week in advance. Menus can be completed on a rotating cycle for 4-12 weeks.
Menus shall be posted in the food preparation area and in a conspicuous place in the child care facility at all times.
Menus shall be planned to include food with variety in texture, color, and shape. Record of dated menus served, and any substitutions made, shall be kept on file for a minimum of one year.
New food shall be introduced to help develop good food habits. Introduce only one new food per meal or snack. Foods used for activities/teaching can be included on the written record of foods served for the day.
It is the facility’s responsibility to discuss recurring eating problems with the child's parent.
IV. Child Requiring a Special Diet
A child requiring a special diet due to medical reasons, allergic reactions, or religious beliefs, shall be provided meals and snacks in accordance with the child's needs. If medical reasons exist for the special diet, a medical prescription from the child’s physician stating that the special diet is medically necessary is required. Information required for dietary modifications include:
Child’s full name and date of instructions, updated annually;
Any dietary restrictions based on the special needs;
Any special feeding or eating utensils;
Any foods to be omitted from the diet and any foods to be substituted; Limitations of life activities;

Raw vegetables and foods that may cause choking in young children shall not be served to children less than two years of age.
VI. Choking Prevention
A caregiver shall join the children while they are eating. This is an opportunity to teach
socialization skills, nutrition education, and is a safety measure to help prevent choking.
Children should be encouraged to eat slowly, take small bites, and chew well before swallowing.
FOODS THAT MAY CAUSE CHOKING
Sausage shaped meats (hot dogs)* Hard Candy*
Nuts
Grapes Gum* Dried Fruits
*Not allowed to be served
To Reduce Choking Hazards
Pop Corn
Chips*
Thick Pretzels Rods* Thin pretzel sticks and rounds would be allowed
Chunks of peanut butter
Marshmallows
Cook food until soft and cut into thin slices or small pieces. Remove bones from meat, chicken, and fish, and remove seeds and pits from fruit. With toddlers, cutting foods into “pea” size is recommended.
VII. Feeding of Infants
When a pregnant mother is visiting the facility to consider enrollment, breastfeeding
should be encouraged.
Breast milk is the recommended feeding for infants and should be encouraged and supported by child care facility staff. The mother may choose to come to the child care facility to nurse her infant, or may choose to supply bottles of expressed breast milk for the child care facility staff to feed the infant. To help a mother be successful with breastfeeding the faculty may:
1. Encourage the mother to come to the facility to breastfeed and provide a Quiet, comfortable and private place to feed;
Place to wash the hands;
Pillow to support her infant if desired;
    A comfortable chair, stool for feet while nursing;
The mother may opt to nurse while in the infants room;
Regulations Governing Licensure of Child Care Facilities
Amended July 12, 2017, Effective August 16, 2017

2. Encourage the mother to provide a back-up supply of frozen breast milk that is labeled with the infant’s name and date of expression. The mother’s expressed milk shall be used for her infant only. Note: Excessive shaking of human milk may damage some components that are valuable to the infant.
The Centers for Disease Control’s (CDC) guidelines for storage of frozen expressed breast milk are as follows:
Freezer compartment of a refrigerator at a temperature of 5   F or -15   C the expressed breast milk can be safely stored for 2 weeks
Freezer compartment of refrigerator with separate doors 0° F or -18° C the expressed breast milk can be safely stored for 3-6 months
Freezer compartment of refrigerator with separate doors -4° F or -20° C the expressed breast milk can be safely stored for 6-12 months
Note: Store milk toward the back of the freezer, where temperature is most constant. Milk stored for longer durations in the ranges listed is safe, but some of the lipids in the milk undergo degradation resulting in lower quality. You can go to the CDC website at http://www.cdc.gov/breastfeeding/recommendations/handling_breastmilk.htm for more information.
3. Note: for the breast fed infant, it is acceptable to introduce iron-fortified cereal earlier, at four months if desired, but preferably at 6 months.
A written schedule for feeding the infant shall be provided by the parent and posted for reference by the child care facility staff.
Feeding should be by hunger cues whenever possible. Hunger cues may include: Sucking on his tongue, lips, hands, or fingers while asleep
Moving his arms and hands toward his mouth
Restless movements while asleep
        Rapid eye movements under his eyelids Opening his mouth when his lips are touched “Rooting” or searching for the nipple Making small sounds
Late hunger cues include:
Crying Fussiness
Signals when an infant is full and feeding should stop:
“Falls off” the breast, releasing the nipple; Falls asleep; or
Relaxes his body and opens his fists.

Breast milk or formula shall be brought to the child care facility daily, ready to be warmed and fed. Each bottle shall be labeled with the infant's name and the date. No cereal, juice or other foods may be added to the infant’s breast milk/formula without a physician’s written request, as done for a child with special needs.
Bottles should be warmed for five minutes in a pan of hot, not boiling water; never microwave. Before feeding, test the temperature by squirting a couple of drops on the back of your hand.
At the end of each feeding, discard any milk left in the bottle. Staff will send all used bottles home with the parent for proper cleaning and sanitizing.
Age-appropriate solid foods (complimentary foods) may be introduced no sooner than when the child has reached 4 months of age, but ideally at six months. The first food introduced usually is cereal mixed with breast milk or formula (not in a bottle). Adding juice to dry cereal is not allowed.
Commercially prepared baby foods shall be brought in unopened jars and labeled with the infant's name. Home prepared/blended and home canned infant foods shall not be served. A facility may chose to mash and puree the foods served to older children for the infants 7 months to one year - no additional juice, sauces, or fats may be added to the pureed foods.
Iron-fortified dry infant cereal shall be brought in sealed container premeasured for each feeding and labeled with the infant’s name.
Juice shall not be served to infants (children less than 12 months of age).
A small amount of water is encouraged at 8-12 months.
Infants shall be held cradled in the arms during feeding. At no time shall an infant be fed by propping a bottle.
Introduction of solid foods to an infant should be done in consultation with the parent and/or according to the schedule of the Mississippi State Department of Health Infant Feeding Guide.
Solid foods must be spoon-fed. No solid foods shall be fed by bottle or infant feeder without written direction from a physician.
Infants are fed when hungry by noting hunger cues, such as crying, being restless. Feeding is stopped when it is determined that the infant is satisfied. Signs of satiety include, refusing the nurse, turning away from the nipple, falling asleep.
Infants are encouraged to start using a cup at six to nine months, based upon motor skills. When the cup is used, the breast milk or formula may be brought into the center in a

clean closed container that is clearly labeled. By the age of one, all children should be off a bottle.
Older infants are encouraged to hold and drink from cups, to use child appropriate eating and serving utensils. Self-feeding should be encouraged. All food should be served in a manner to prevent choking, such as mashing, cutting in small “pea” size portions.
Breast or formula is served to at least 12 months. Cow's milk is not served until age one, unless provided with a written exception from the infant’s physician. Children ages one to two, shall be served whole cow’s milk, after age two, toddlers should be served fat free/skim milk. When there are children older than two in the classroom with younger children, all children shall be served the whole milk.
Guidelines for Milk Storage and Use for All Infants
From the ACOG/AAP publication: Breastfeeding Handbook for Physicians
When centers are reimbursed for meals and must supply formula for their infants, only ready to use formula may be purchased for use. The center may require the parents to supply clean bottles daily. If the center supplies the bottles, there must be provisions in place for the proper cleaning, sanitizing, and drying of all bottles and supplies outside of the infant room.

MENU PLANNING
Dietary Guidelines for Americans provide assistance in planning meals for ages two and older, which will promote health and prevent disease.
The guidelines, applied to child care feeding are:
1. Offer a variety of foods.
2. Serve meals and snacks that help maintain a healthy weight.
Regulations Governing Licensure of Child Care Facilities
Amended July 12, 2017, Effective August 16, 2017
Office of Health Protection Child Care Facilities Licensure Division

3. Serve fresh, frozen, canned, or dried vegetables, fruits whenever possible, and whole grain products.
4. Avoid excessive fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol. No fried foods or foods with transfats shall be served.
5. Use and serve sugar only in meal preparation and then in moderation. No concentrated sweets, such as candy, syrup, sweetened drinks sodas, or flavored milks may be served.
6. Limit sodium products and the use of salt.
7. Promote an alcohol, tobacco and drug free lifestyle for children, parents, and caregivers.
8. Promote and encourage daily physical activity.
PARTIES AND SPECIAL OCCASIONS
Parties and special party type events should not be held more that once a month. Food for parties should be prepared at the facility when possible. It is recommended that if foods for the event are brought to the facility by parents it should be “store bought” and not “home cooked.”
It is suggested that a plain “store bought” cake be served. Other items may include ice cream, fresh fruit, cheese and crackers, and party favors such as stickers, books, toothbrushes, crayons, etc., are encouraged.
Meal Pattern Points to Remember
Keep in mind the following points when you plan menus to meet meal pattern requirements for each of the food groups.
Plan your meats first. Then select fruits and vegetables, making sure that you have a Vitamin C source daily and a Vitamin A source every other day, or three times a week. Refer to the vitamin tables. Limit starchy vegetables to once/day - these include lima beans, butterbeans, white/sweet potatoes, English peas, black-eye peas, field peas, Crowder peas, cream and whole kernel corn, any dried pea/bean(unless counted for a meat substitute).
Two vegetables or two fruits may be served at the mealtime, but it is recommended to serve a vegetable and a fruit for variety. Including brightly colored fruits and vegetables, such as tomatoes, broccoli, carrots, greens, strawberries, melon, peaches, will help to meet the vitamin requirements.
The same meal may not be served more than once in a day (i.e. facilities who are open for lunch and supper may not serve the same meal for both meals).
Snacks are to be served mid-morning (if required), early afternoon, and late afternoon, usually 30-60 minutes before closing. Water can be used as the beverage while foods are served.

Snack time is an excellent time to introduce fruits and vegetables.
Use only 100-percent-strength juice for snack no more than once a day. Give fruit for breakfast/morning snack instead of juice.
Juice should not be served as part of the snack when milk is the only other component. It is poor menu planning to offer such a combination since it provides too much liquid for children.
Fruit-flavored drinks, sport drinks, soft drinks, caffeinated beverages, artificially sweetened beverages shall not be served.
Avoid serving two forms of the same fruit or vegetable in the same day. Example: an orange and orange juice or an apple and applesauce are combinations that should not be used. Serve a variety of vegetables and fruits to ensure a nutritionally well-balanced meal.
Dry milk shall not be used as a milk beverage, but may be used for cooking purposes.
Guidelines from USDA FNS (US Department of Agriculture Food Nutrition Supplement) program are used as the standard for menu planning and guidelines. However, when one set of guidelines are stricter then the stricter guidelines shall be enforced (in comparing MSDH and USDA FNS). Emphasis shall be placed on serving more whole grains and fewer foods high in fat, sugar, and sodium.
Drinking water shall be freely available to children of all ages and offered at frequent intervals. Extra water served with meals, snacks, and during and after physical activity is encouraged. Facilities may have water fountains in the classroom or dining area. This water source should be encouraged before and after all meals and snacks and takes the place of water served at the table.
To prevent nutrient and vitamin loss from foods during preparation, cooking, or storage, try to o Serve fruits and vegetables raw as appropriate for the age. The risk of choking is
greater for the child under the age of two.
o Steam, boil, or simmer foods in a very small amount of water, or microwave for the
shortest time possible.
o Cook potatoes in their skins. Be sure to wash the dirt off the outside of the potato.
o Refrigerate prepared juices and store them for no more than two to three days.
o Store cut raw fruits and vegetables in an airtight container and refrigerate - do not soak
or store in water. Nutrients may be diluted from soaking in water. Manufacturer packaged fresh fruits and vegetables are the exception due to packaging processes.

DENTAL CARE
Dental care is encouraged after each meal service. Parents shall supply toothbrushes and tooth powders or pastes for the child's individual use. Recommendations include replacing the brush every three months or when bristles are bent.
Each toothbrush and powder or paste must be:
Labeled with the child's full name
Stored out of children's reach when not in use
Stored in a manner that prevents the toothbrushes from touching each other during storage
Staff is encouraged to attend trainings on dental care that includes:
Proper tooth brushing technique as appropriate for the child’s age and skills. Education to train parents about proper oral healthcare techniques.
Education for staff and parents to learn the appropriate techniques to feed infants and children that minimize damage to teeth and facial development.
Children must have adult supervision during tooth brushing activities.
GARDENING AND FRESH PRODUCE
Gardening is an excellent opportunity to incorporate physical activity with nutrition education. Facilities are encouraged to have gardening projects with the children. Produce that is grown in the gardens may be washed and handled properly to allow the items to be served for a snack time or education activity.
Purchasing local produce from Mississippi farmers is one way to offer fresh items to the children. This also helps the local economy and raising families’ awareness of food sources. The child care center must ensure the safety of foods served. Steps must be taken to demonstrate reasonable care has been taken to ensure the safety of foods purchased. Steps include: Investigating the local farm and production practices, communicating with the local farmer on the needs of the facility including packaging, delivery, and payment procedures, and promoting the use of local produce with families and the community. There are several resources available to use as a safety checklist, such as the Iowa State University Checklist for Retail Purchasing of Local Produce. The checklist is on the www.HealthyMS.com website under Nutrition and Farm to School and Preschool.

1. INTRODUCTION
In recent years, it is estimated that there were more than 200,000 injuries annually on public playgrounds across the country that required emergency room treatment. By following the recommended guidelines in this handbook, you and your community can create a safer playground environment for all children and contribute to the reduc- tion of playground-related deaths and injuries.
1.1 Scope
This handbook presents safety information for public play- ground equipment in the form of guidelines. Publication of this handbook is expected to promote greater safety aware- ness among those who purchase, install, and maintain public playground equipment. Because many factors may affect playground safety, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) staff believes that guidelines, rather than a mandatory rule, are appropriate. These guidelines are not being issued as the sole method to minimize injuries associated with playground equipment. However, the Commission believes that the recommendations in this handbook along with the technical information in the ASTM standards for public playgrounds will contribute to greater playground safety.
Some states and local jurisdictions may require compliance with this handbook and/or ASTM voluntary standards. Additionally, risk managers, insurance companies, or others may require compliance at a particular site; check with state/local jurisdictions and insurance companies for specific requirements.
1.2 Intended Audience
This handbook is intended for use by childcare personnel, school officials, parks and recreation personnel, equipment purchasers and installers, playground designers, and any other members of the general public (e.g., parents and school groups) concerned with public playground safety and inter- ested in evaluating their respective playgrounds. Due to the wide range of possible users, some information provided may be more appropriate for certain users than others. The voluntary standards listed in 1.4.1 contain more technical requirements than this handbook and are primarily intended for use by equipment manufacturers, architects, designers, and any others requiring more technical information.
1.3 What is a Public Playground?
“Public” playground equipment refers to equipment for use by children ages 6 months through 12 years in the play- ground areas of:
• Commercial (non-residential) child care facilities
• Institutions
• Multiple family dwellings, such as apartment and condo- minium buildings
• Parks, such as city, state, and community maintained parks
• Restaurants
• Resorts and recreational developments
• Schools
• Other areas of public use
These guidelines are not intended for amusement park equipment, sports or fitness equipment normally intended for users over the age of 12 years, soft contained play equip- ment, constant air inflatable play devices for home use, art and museum sculptures (not otherwise designed, intended and installed as playground equipment), equipment found in water play facilities, or home playground equipment. Equipment components intended solely for children with disabilities and modified to accommodate such users also are not covered by these guidelines. Child care facilities, espe- cially indoor, should refer to ASTM F2373 — Standard Consumer Safety Performance Specification for Public Use Play Equipment for Children 6 Months Through 23 Months, for more guidance on areas unique to their facilities.
1.4 Public Playground Safety Voluntary Standards and CPSC Handbook History

1.6 Background
The safety of each individual piece of playground equipment as well as the layout of the entire play area should be consid- ered when designing or evaluating a playground for safety. Since falls are a very common playground hazard pattern, the installation and maintenance of protective surfacing under and around all equipment is crucial to protect chil- dren from severe head injuries.
Because all playgrounds present some challenge and because children can be expected to use equipment in unintended and unanticipated ways, adult supervision is highly recom- mended. The handbook provides some guidance on supervi- sory practices that adults should follow. Appropriate equip- ment design, layout, and maintenance, as discussed in this
 2

handbook, are also essential for increasing public playground safety.
A playground should allow children to develop gradually and test their skills by providing a series of graduated challenges. The challenges presented should be appropriate for age- related abilities and should be ones that children can per- ceive and choose to undertake. Toddlers, preschool- and school-age children differ dramatically, not only in physical size and ability, but also in their intellectual and social skills. Therefore, age-appropriate playground designs should accommodate these differences with regard to the type, scale, and the layout of equipment. Recommendations throughout this handbook address the different needs of tod- dlers, preschool-age, and school-age children; “toddlers” refers to children ages 6 months through 2 years of age, “preschool-age” refers to children 2 through 5 years, and “school-age” refers to children 5 through 12 years. The over- lap between these groups is anticipated in terms of play- ground equipment use and provides for a margin of safety.
Playground designers, installers and operators should be aware that the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) is a comprehensive civil rights law which prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability. Titles II and III of the ADA require, among other things, that newly construct- ed and altered State and local government facilities, places of public accommodation, and commercial facilities be readi- ly accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities. Recreation facilities, including play areas, are among the types of facilities covered by titles II and III of the ADA.
The Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Boards – also referred to as the “Access Board” – has devel- oped accessibility guidelines for newly constructed and altered play areas that were published October 2000. The play area guidelines are a supplement to the Americans with Disabilities Act Accessibility Guidelines (ADAAG). Once these guidelines are adopted as enforceable standards by the Department of Justice, all newly constructed and altered play areas covered by the ADA will be required to comply. These guidelines also apply to play areas covered by the Architectural Barriers Act (ABA).
Copies of the play area accessibility guidelines and further technical assistance can be obtained from the U.S. Access Board, 1331 F Street, NW, Suite 1000, Washington, DC 20004-1111; 800-872-2253, 800-993-2822 (TTY), www.access-board.gov.

Handbook for Public Playground Safety
 1.7 Playground Injuries
The U. S. Consumer Product Safety Commission has long recognized the potential hazards that exist with the use of playground equipment, with over 200,000 estimated emer- gency room-treated injuries annually. The most recent study of 2,691 playground equipment-related incidents reported to the CPSC from 2001-2008 indicated that falls are the most common hazard pattern (44% of injuries) followed by equipment-related hazards, such as breakage, tip over, design, and assembly (23%).1 Other hazard patterns involved entrapment and colliding other children or stationary equipment. Playground-related deaths reported to the Commission involved entanglement of ropes, leashes, or clothing; falls; and impact from equipment tip over or struc- tural failure.
The recommendations in this handbook have been devel- oped to address the hazards that resulted in playground- related injuries and deaths. The recommendations include those that address:
• The potential for falls from and impact with equipment
• The need for impact attenuating protective surfacing under and around equipment
• Openings with the potential for head entrapment
• The scale of equipment and other design features related to user age and layout of equipment on a playground
• Installation and maintenance procedures
• General hazards presented by protrusions, sharp edges, and crush or shear points

2. GENERAL PLAYGROUND CONSIDERATIONS
2.1 Selecting a Site
The following factors are important when selecting a site for a new playground:
Handbook for Public Playground Safety
  Site Factor
Questions to Ask
If yes, then...Mitigation
Travel patterns of children to and from the playground
Are there hazards in the way?
Clear hazards.
Nearby accessible hazards such as roads with traffic, lakes, ponds, streams, drop-offs/cliffs, etc.
Could a child inadvertently run into a nearby hazard?
Could younger children easily wander off toward the hazard?
Provide a method to contain chil- dren within the playground. For example, a dense hedge or a fence. The method should allow for observation by supervisors. If fences are used, they should conform to local building codes and/or ASTM F-209.
Sun exposure
Is sun exposure sufficient to heat exposed bare metal slides, plat- forms, steps, & surfacing enough to burn children?
Bare metal slides, platforms, and steps should be shaded or locat- ed out of direct sun.
Provide warnings that equipment and surfacing exposed to intense sun can burn.
Will children be exposed to the sun during the most intense part of the day?
Consider shading the playground or providing shaded areas near- by.
Slope and drainage
Will loose fill materials wash away during periods of heavy rain?
Consider proper drainage re- grading to prevent wash outs.
         2.1.1 Shading considerations
According to the American Academy of Dermatology, research indicates that one in five Americans will develop some form of skin cancer during their lifetime, and five or more sunburns double the risk of developing skin cancer. Utilizing existing shade (e.g., trees), designing play structures as a means for providing shading (e.g., elevated platforms with shaded space below), or creating more shade (e.g., man- made structures) are potential ways to design a playground to help protect children’s skin from the sun. When trees are used for shade, additional maintenance issues arise, such as the need for cleaning up debris and trimming limbs.
2.2 Playground Layout
There are several key factors to keep in mind when laying out a playground:
• Accessibility
• Age separation
• Conflicting activities
• Sight lines
• Signage and/or labeling • Supervision
 5

Handbook for Public Playground Safety
 2.2.1 Accessibility
Special consideration should be given to providing accessible surfaces in a play area that meets the ASTM Standard Specification for Determination of Accessibility of Surface Systems Under and Around Playground Equipment, ASTM F1951. Equipment selection and location along with the type of pro- tective surfacing are key components to ensuring the oppor- tunity for children with disabilities to play on the playground.
2.2.2 Age separation
For playgrounds intended to serve children of all ages, the layout of pathways and the landscaping of the playground should show the distinct areas for the different age groups. The areas should be separated at least by a buffer zone, which could be an area with shrubs or benches. This separation and buffer zone will reduce the chance of injury from older, more active children running through areas filled with younger children with generally slower movement and reaction times.
2.2.3 Age group
In areas where access to the playground is unlimited or enforced only by signage, the playground designer should recognize that since child development is fluid, parents and caregivers may select a playground slightly above or slightly below their child's abilities, especially for children at or near a cut-off age (e.g., 2-years old and 5-years old). This could be for ease of supervising multiple children, misperceptions about the hazards a playground may pose to children of a dif- ferent age, advanced development of a child, or other rea- sons. For this reason, there is an overlap at age 5. Developmentally a similar overlap also exists around age 2; however, due to the differences in ASTM standards and entrapment testing tools, this overlap is not reflected in the handbook. Playgrounds used primarily by children under the supervision of paid, trained professionals (e.g., child-care centers and schools) may wish to consider separating play- grounds by the facility's age groupings. For example, a child- care facility may wish to limit a playground to toddlers under 2 exclusively and can draw information from this guide and ASTM F2373. A school, on the other hand, may have no children under 4 attending, and can likewise plan appropri- ately. Those who inspect playgrounds should use the intend- ed age group of the playground.
2.2.4 Conflicting activities
The play area should be organized into different sections to prevent injuries caused by conflicting activities and children running between activities. Active, physical activities should be separate from more passive or quiet activities. Areas for playground equipment, open fields, and sand boxes should be located in different sections of the playground. In addi- tion, popular, heavy-use pieces of equipment or activities should be dispersed to avoid crowding in any one area.
Different types of equipment have different use zones that must be maintained. The following are general recommenda- tions for locating equipment within the playground site. Specific use zones for equipment are given in §5.3.
• Moving equipment, such as swings and merry-go-rounds, should be located toward a corner, side, or edge of the play area while ensuring that the appropriate use zones around the equipment are maintained.
• Slide exits should be located in an uncongested area of the playground.
• Composite play structures have become increasingly popular on public playgrounds. Adjacent components on composite structures should be complementary. For example, an access component should not be located in a slide exit zone.
2.2.5 Sight lines
Playgrounds that are designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with safety guidelines and standards can still pre- sent hazards to children. Playgrounds should be laid out to allow parents or caregivers to keep track of children as they move throughout the playground environment. Visual barri- ers should be minimized as much as possible. For example, in a park situation, playground equipment should be as visible as possible from park benches. In playgrounds with areas for different ages, the older children’s area should be visible from the younger children’s area to ensure that caregivers of mul- tiple children can see older children while they are engaged in interactive play with younger ones.
2.2.6 Signage and/or labeling
Although the intended user group should be obvious from the design and scale of equipment, signs and/or labels posted in the playground area or on the equipment should give some guidance to supervisors as to the age appropriateness of the equipment.

Handbook for Public Playground Safety
  2.2.7 Supervision
The quality of the super-
vision depends on the
quality of the supervisor’s
knowledge of safe play
behavior. Playground
designers should be
aware of the type of supervision most likely for their given playground. Depending on the location and nature of the playground, the supervisors may be paid professionals (e.g., childcare, elementary school or park and recreation person- nel), paid seasonal workers (e.g., college or high school stu- dents), volunteers (e.g., PTA members), or unpaid caregivers (e.g., parents) of the children playing in the playground.
Parents and playground supervisors should be aware that not all playground equipment is appropriate for all children who may use the playground. Supervisors should look for posted
signs indicating the appropriate age of the users and direct children to equipment appropriate for their age. Supervisors may also use the information in Table 1 to determine the suitability of the equipment for the children they are super- vising. Toddlers and preschool-age children require more attentive supervision than older children; however, one should not rely on supervision alone to prevent injuries.
Supervisors should understand the basics of playground safety such as:
• Checking for broken equipment and making sure children don’t play on it.
• Checking for and removing unsafe modifications, especial- ly ropes tied to equipment, before letting children play.
• Checking for properly maintained protective surfacing. • Making sure children are wearing foot wear.

 • Watching and stopping dangerous horseplay, such as chil- dren throwing protective surfacing materials, jumping from heights, etc.
• Watching for and stopping children from wandering away from the play area.
2.3 Selecting Equipment
When selecting playground equipment, it is important to know the age range of the children who will be using the playground. Children at different ages and stages of develop- ment have different needs and abilities. Playgrounds should be designed to stimulate children and encourage them to develop new skills, but should be in scale with their sizes, abilities, and developmental levels. Consideration should also be given to providing play equipment that is accessible to children with disabilities and encourages integration with- in the playground.
Table 1 shows the appropriate age range for various pieces of playground equipment. This is not an all-comprehensive list and, therefore, should not limit inclusion of current or newly designed equipment that is not specifically mentioned. For equipment listed in more than one group, there may be some modifications or restrictions based on age, so consult the specific recommendations in §5.3.
2.3.1 Equipment not recommended
Some playground equipment is not recommended for use on public playgrounds, including:
• Trampolines
• Swinging gates
• Giant strides
• Climbing ropes that are not secured at both ends.
• Heavy metal swings (e.g., animal figures) – These are not recommended because their heavy rigid metal framework presents a risk of impact injury.
• Multiple occupancy swings – With the exception of tire swings, swings that are intended for more than one user are not recommended because their greater mass, as compared to single occupancy swings, presents a risk of impact injury.
• Rope swings – Free-swinging ropes that may fray or other- wise form a loop are not recommended because they pre- sent a potential strangulation hazard.
• Swinging dual exercise rings and trapeze bars – These are rings and trapeze bars on long chains that are generally considered to be items of athletic equipment and are not recommended for public playgrounds. NOTE: The recom- mendation against the use of exercise rings does not apply to overhead hanging rings such as those used in a ring trek or ring ladder (see Figure 7).
2.4 Surfacing
The surfacing under and around playground equip- ment is one of the most important factors in reducing the likelihood of life-threat- ening head injuries. A fall onto a shock absorbing sur- face is less likely to cause a
serious head injury than a fall onto a hard surface. However, some injuries from falls, including broken limbs, may occur no matter what playground surfacing material is used.
The most widely used test method for evaluating the shock absorbing properties of a playground surfacing material is to drop an instrumented metal headform onto a sample of the material and record the acceleration/time pulse during the impact. Field and laboratory test methods are described in ASTM F1292 Standard Specification for Impact Attenuation of Surface Systems Under and Around Playground Equipment.
Testing using the methods described in ASTM F1292 will provide a “critical height” rating of the surface. This height can be considered as an approximation of the fall height below which a life-threatening head injury would not be expected to occur. Manufacturers and installers of play- ground protective surfacing should provide the critical height rating of their materials. This rating should be greater than or equal to the fall height of the highest piece of equip- ment on the playground. The fall height of a piece of equip- ment is the distance between the highest designated play surface on a piece of equipment and the protective surface beneath it. Details for determining the highest designated play surface and fall height on some types of equipment are included in §5 Parts of the Playground.
2.4.1 Equipment not covered by protective surfacing recommendations
The recommendations for protective surfacing do not apply to equipment that requires a child to be standing or sitting at ground level. Examples of such equipment are:
  

• Sand boxes
• Activity walls at ground level
• Play houses
• Any other equipment that children use when their feet remain in contact with the ground surface
2.4.2 Selecting a surfacing material
There are two options available for surfacing public play- grounds: unitary and loose-fill materials. A playground should never be installed without protective surfacing of some type. Concrete, asphalt, or other hard surfaces should never be directly under playground equipment. Grass and dirt are not considered protective surfacing because wear and environmental factors can reduce their shock absorbing effec- tiveness. Carpeting and mats are also not appropriate unless they are tested to and comply with ASTM F1292. Loose-fill should be avoided for playgrounds intended for toddlers.
2..2.1 Unitary surfacing materials
Unitary materials are generally rubber mats and tiles or a combination of energy-absorbing materials held in place by a
binder that may be poured in place at the playground site and then cured to form a unitary shock absorbing surface. Unitary materials are available from a number of different manufacturers, many of whom have a range of materials with differing shock absorbing properties. New surfacing materi- als, such as bonded wood fiber and combinations of loose-fill and unitary, are being developed that may also be tested to ASTM F1292 and fall into the unitary materials category. When deciding on the best surfacing materials keep in mind that some dark colored surfacing materials exposed to the intense sun have caused blistering on bare feet. Check with the manufacturer if light colored materials are available or provide shading to reduce direct sun exposure.
Persons wishing to install a unitary material as a playground surface should request ASTM F1292 test data from the manu- facturer identifying the critical height rating of the desired sur- face. In addition, site requirements should be obtained from the manufacturer because some unitary materials require installation over a hard surface while others do not. Manufacturer’s instructions should be followed closely, as some unitary systems require professional installation. Testing should be conducted in accordance with the ASTM F1292 standard.

Handbook for Public Playground Safety
 2..2.2 Loose-fill surfacing materials
Engineered wood fiber (EWF) is a wood product that may look similar in appearance to landscaping mulch, but EWF products are designed specifically for use as a playground safety surface under and around playground equipment. EWF products should meet the specifications in ASTM F2075: Standard Specification for Engineered Wood Fiber and be tested to and comply with ASTM F1292.
There are also rubber mulch products that are designed specifically for use as playground surfacing. Make sure they have been tested to and comply with ASTM F1292.
When installing these products, tips 1-9 listed below should be followed. Each manufacturer of engineered wood fiber and rubber mulch should provide maintenance requirements for and test data on:
• Critical height based on ASTM F1292 impact attenuation testing.
• Minimum fill-depth data.
• Toxicity.
• ADA/ABA accessibility guidelines for firmness and stabil- ity based on ASTM F1951.
Other loose-fill materials are generally landscaping-type materials that can be layered to a certain depth and resist compacting. Some examples include wood mulch, wood chips, sand, pea gravel, and shredded/recycled rubber mulch.
Important tips when considering loose-fill materials:
1. Loose-fill materials will compress at least 25% over time due to use and weathering. This must be considered when planning the playground. For example, if the playground will require 9 inches of wood chips, then the initial fill level should be 12 inches. See Table 2 below.
2. Loose-fill surfacing requires frequent maintenance to ensure surfacing levels never drop below the minimum depth. Areas under swings and at slide exits are more sus- ceptible to displacement; special attention must be paid to maintenance in these areas. Additionally, wear mats can be installed in these areas to reduce displacement.
3. The perimeter of the playground should provide a method of containing the loose-fill materials.
4. Consider marking equipment supports with a minimum fill level to aid in maintaining the original depth of material.
5. Good drainage is essential to maintaining loose-fill surfacing. Standing water with surfacing material reduces effectiveness and leads to material compaction and decomposition.
6. Critical height may be reduced during winter in areas where the ground freezes.
7. Never use less than 9 inches of loose-fill material except for shredded/recycled rubber (6 inches recommended). Shallower depths are too easily displaced and compacted
8. Some loose-fill materials may not meet ADA/ABA acces- sibility guidelines. For more information, contact the Access Board (see §1.6) or refer to ASTM F1951.
9. Wood mulch containing chromated copper arsenate (CCA)-treated wood products should not be used; mulch where the CCA-content is unknown should be avoided (see §2.5.5.1).
Table 2 shows the minimum required depths of loose-fill material needed based on material type and fall height. The depths shown assume the materials have been compressed due to use and weathering and are properly maintained to the given level.
2..2.3 Installing loose-fill over hard surface
CPSC staff strongly recommends against installing play- grounds over hard surfaces, such as asphalt, concrete, or hard packed earth, unless the installation adds the following layers of protection. Immediately over the hard surface there should be a 3- to 6-inch base layer of loose-fill (e.g., gravel for drainage). The next layer should be a Geotextile cloth. On top of that should be a loose-fill layer meeting the speci- fications addressed in §2.4.2.2 and Table 2. Embedded in the loose-fill layer should be impact attenuating mats under high traffic areas, such as under swings, at slide exits, and other places where displacement is likely. Figure 1 provides a visual representation of this information. Older playgrounds that still exist on hard surfacing should be modified to provide appropriate surfacing.
2.5 Equipment Materials
2.5.1 Durability and finish
• Use equipment that is manufactured and constructed only of materials that have a demonstrated record of durability in a playground or similar setting.

 • Finishes, treatments, and preservatives should be selected carefully so that they do not present a health hazard to users.
2.5.2 Hardware
When installed and maintained in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions:
• All fasteners, connectors, and covering devices should not loosen or be removable without the use of tools.
• All fasteners, connectors, and covering devices that are exposed to the user should be smooth and should not be likely to cause laceration, penetration, or present a cloth- ing entanglement hazard (see also §3.2 and Appendix B).
• Lock washers, self-locking nuts, or other locking means should be provided for all nuts and bolts to protect them from detachment.
• Hardware in moving joints should also be secured against unintentional or unauthorized loosening.
 11

Handbook for Public Playground Safety
 • All fasteners should be corrosion resistant and be selected to minimize corrosion of the materials they connect. This is particularly important when using wood treated with ACQ/CBA/CA-B2 as the chemicals in the wood preserva- tive corrode certain metals faster than others.
• Bearings or bushings used in moving joints should be easy to lubricate or be self-lubricating.
• All hooks, such as S-hooks and C-hooks, should be closed (see also §5.3.8.1). A hook is considered closed if there is no gap or space greater than 0.04 inches, about the thick- ness of a dime.
2.5.3 Metals
• Avoid using bare metal for platforms, slides, or steps. When exposed to direct sunlight they may reach tempera- tures high enough to cause serious contact burn injuries in a matter of seconds. Use other materials that may reduce the surface temperature, such as but not limited to wood, plastic, or coated metal (see also Slides in §5.3.6).
• If bare or painted metal surfaces are used on platforms, steps, and slide beds, they should be oriented so that the surface is not exposed to direct sun year round.
2.5.4 Paints and finishes
• Metals not inherently corrosion resistant should be paint- ed, galvanized, or otherwise treated to prevent rust.
• The manufacturer should ensure that the users cannot ingest, inhale, or absorb potentially hazardous amounts of preservative chemicals or other treatments applied to the equipment as a result of contact with playground equipment.
• All paints and other similar finishes must meet the current CPSC regulation for lead in paint.
• Painted surfaces should be maintained to prevent corrosion and deterioration.
• Paint and other finishes should be maintained to prevent rusting of exposed metals and to minimize children play- ing with peeling paint and paint flakes.
• Older playgrounds with lead based paints should be iden- tified and a strategy to control lead paint exposure should be developed. Playground managers should consult the October 1996 report, CPSC Staff Recommendations for Identifying and Controlling Lead Paint on Public Playground Equipment, while ensuring that all paints and other similar finishes meet the current CPSC regulation.3
2.5.5 Wood
• Wood should be either naturally rot- and insect-resistant (e.g., cedar or redwood) or should be treated to avoid such deterioration.
• Creosote-treated wood (e.g., railroad ties, telephone poles, etc) and coatings that contain pesticides should not be used.
2.5.5.1 Pressure-treated wood
A significant amount of older playground wood was pres- sure-treated with chemicals to prevent damage from insects and fungi. Chromated copper arsenate (CCA) was a chemi- cal used for decades in structures (including playgrounds). Since December 31, 2003, CCA-treated wood is no longer processed for use in playground applications. Other rot- and insect-resistant pressure treatments are available that do not contain arsenic; however, when using any of the new treated wood products, be sure to use hardware that is compatible with the wood treatment chemicals. These chemicals are known to corrode certain materials faster than others.
Existing playgrounds with CCA-treated wood
Various groups have made suggestions concerning the appli- cation of surface coatings to CCA-treated wood (e.g., stains and sealants) to reduce a child’s potential exposure to arsenic from the wood surface. Data from CPSC staff and EPA studies suggest that regular (at least once a year) use of an oil- or water-based, penetrating sealant or stain can reduce arsenic migration from CCA-treated wood. Installers, builders, and consumers who perform woodworking opera- tions, such as sanding, sawing, or sawdust disposal, on pres- sure-treated wood should read the consumer information sheet available at the point of sale. This sheet contains important health precautions and disposal information.

3 CPSC Staff Recommendations for Identifying and Controlling Lead Paint on Public Playground Equipment; U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission: Washington, DC, October 1996.
 12

When selecting wood products and finishes for public play- grounds, CPSC staff recommends:
• Avoid “film-forming” or non-penetrating stains (latex semi-transparent, latex opaque and oil-based opaque stains) on outdoor surfaces because peeling and flaking may occur later, which will ultimately have an impact on durability as well as exposure to the preservatives in the wood.
• Creosote, pentachlorophenol, and tributyl tin oxide are too toxic or irritating and should not be used as preserva- tives for playground equipment wood.
• Pesticide-containing finishes should not be used.
• CCA-treated wood should not be used as playground mulch.
2.6 Assembly and Installation
• Strictly follow all instructions from the manufacturer when assembling and installing equipment.
• After assembly and before its first use, equipment should be thoroughly inspected by a person qualified to inspect playgrounds for safety.
• The manufacturer’s assembly and installation instructions, and all other materials collected concerning the equip- ment, should be kept in a permanent file.
• Secure anchoring is a key factor to stable installation, and the anchoring process should be completed in strict accor- dance with the manufacturer’s specifications.

 3. PLAYGROUND HAZARDS
This section provides a broad overview of general hazards that should be avoided on playgrounds. It is intended to raise awareness of the risks posed by each of these hazards. Many of these hazards have technical specifications and tests for compliance with ASTM F1487 and F2373. Some of these tests are also detailed in Appendix B.
3.1 Crush and Shearing Points
Anything that could crush or shear limbs should not be accessible to children on a playground. Crush and shear points can be caused by parts moving relative to each other or to a fixed part during a normal use cycle, such as a seesaw.
To determine if there is a possible crush or shear point, consider:
• The likelihood a child could get a body part inside the point, and
• The closing force around the point.
Potential crush/shear hazards specific to certain pieces of equipment are identified in §5.3 Major Types of Playground Equipment.
3.2 Entanglement and Impalement
Projections on playground equipment should not be able to entangle children’s clothing nor should they be large enough
to impale. To avoid this risk:
• The diameter of a projection should not increase in the direction away from the surrounding surface toward the exposed end (see Figure 2).
• Bolts should not expose more than two threads beyond the end of the nut (see Figure 3).
• All hooks, such as S-hooks and C-hooks, should be closed (see also §5.3.8.1). A hook is considered closed if there is no gap or space greater than 0.04 inches, about the thick- ness of a dime.
– Any connecting device containing an in-fill that com- pletely fills the interior space preventing entry of cloth- ing items into the interior of the device is exempt from this requirement.
• Swings and slides have additional recommendations for projections detailed in §5.3.
• See Appendix B for testing recommendations.
3.2.1 Strings and ropes
Drawstrings on the hoods of jackets, sweatshirts, and other upper body clothing can become entangled in playground equipment, and can cause death by strangulation. To avoid this risk:
• Children should not wear jewelry, jackets or sweatshirts with drawstring hoods, mittens connected by strings through the arms, or other upper body clothing with drawstrings.
• Remove any ropes, dog leashes, or similar objects that have been attached to playground equipment. Children can become entangled in them and strangle to death.
   Diameter has increased

• Avoid equipment with ropes that are not secured at both ends.
• The following label, or a similar sign or label, can be placed on or near slides or other equipment where poten- tial entanglements may occur.
opening in one orientation, turn their heads to a different orientation, then are unable to get themselves out. Head entrapment by feet first entry involves children who general- ly sit or lie down and slide their feet into an opening that is large enough to permit their bodies to go through but is not large enough to permit their heads to go through. A part or a group of parts should not form openings that could trap a child’s head. Also, children should not wear their bicycle helmets while on playground equipment. There have been recent head entrapment incidents in which children wearing their bicycle helmets became entrapped in spaces that would not normally be considered a head entrapment.
Certain openings could present an entrapment hazard if the distance between any interior opposing surfaces is greater than 3.5 inches and less than 9 inches. These spaces should be tested as recommended in Appendix B. When one dimension of an opening is within this range, all dimensions of the opening should be considered together to evaluate the possibility of entrapment. Even openings that are low enough for children’s feet to touch the ground can present a risk of strangulation for an entrapped child. (See Figure 4). Younger children may not have the necessary intellectual ability or motor skills to reverse the process that caused their heads to become trapped, especially if they become scared or panicked.
Handbook for Public Playground Safety
   WARNING
   Children have died when drawstrings on their clothing caught on slides or other playground equipment.
Remove hood and neck drawstrings from children’s clothing before children play on a playground.
Remove scarves and mittens connected through the sleeves.
 3.3 Entrapment
3.3.1 Head entrapment
Head entrapment is a serious concern on playgrounds, since it could lead to strangulation and death. A child’s head may become entrapped if the child enters an opening either feet first or head first. Head entrapment by head-first entry gen- erally occurs when children place their heads through an

3.3.2 Partially bound openings and angles
Children can become entrapped by partially bound openings, such as those formed by two or more playground parts.
• Angles formed by two accessible adjacent parts should be greater than 55 degrees unless the lowest leg is horizontal or below horizontal.
• Use the partially-bound opening test in Appendix B to identify hazardous angles and other partially-bound openings.
3.4 Sharp Points, Corners, and Edges
Sharp points, corners, or edges on any part of the playground or playground equipment may cut or puncture a child’s skin. Sharp edges can cause serious lacerations if protective measures are not taken. To avoid the risk of injury from sharp points, corners and edges:
• Exposed open ends of all tubing not resting on the ground or otherwise covered should be covered by caps or plugs that cannot be removed without the use of tools.
• Wood parts should be smooth and free from splinters.
• All corners, metal and wood, should be rounded.
• All metal edges should be rolled or have rounded capping.
• There should be no sharp edges on slides. Pay special attention to metal edges of slides along the sides and at the exit (see also §5.3.6.4).
• If steel-belted radials are used as playground equipment, they should be closely examined regularly to ensure that there are no exposed steel belts/wires.
• Conduct frequent inspections to help prevent injuries caused by splintered wood, sharp points, corners, or edges that may develop as a result of wear and tear on the equipment.
3.5 Suspended Hazards
Children using a playground may be injured if they run into or trip over suspended components (such as cables, wires, ropes, or other flexible parts) connected from one piece of the playground equipment to another or hanging to the ground. These suspended components can become hazards when they are within 45 degrees of horizontal and are less than 7 feet above the protective surfacing. To avoid a sus- pended hazard, suspended components:
• Should be located away from high traffic areas.
• Should either be brightly colored or contrast with the sur- rounding equipment and surfacing.
• Should not be able to be looped back on themselves or other ropes, cables, or chains to create a circle with a 5 inch or greater perimeter.
• Should be fastened at both ends unless they are 7 inches or less long or attached to a swing seat.
These recommendations do not apply to swings, climbing nets, or if the suspended component is more than 7 feet above the protective surfacing and is a minimum of one inch at its widest cross-section dimension.
3.6 Tripping Hazards
Play areas should be free of tripping hazards (i.e., sudden change in elevations) to children who are using a play- ground. Two common causes of tripping are anchoring devices for playground equipment and containment walls for loose-fill surfacing materials.
• All anchoring devices for playground equipment, such as concrete footings or horizontal bars at the bottom of flexible climbers, should be installed below ground level
 1

and beneath the base of the protective surfacing material. This will also prevent children from sustaining additional injuries from impact if they fall on exposed footings.
• Contrasting the color of the surfacing with the equipment color can contribute to better visibility.
• Surfacing containment walls should be highly visible.
• Any change of elevation should be obvious.
• Contrasting the color of the containment barrier with the surfacing color can contribute to better visibility.
3.7 Used Tires
Used automobile and truck tires are often recycled as play- ground equipment, such as tire swings or flexible climbers, or as a safety product such as cushioning under a seesaw or shredded as protective surfacing. When recycling tires for playground use:
• Steel-belted radials should be closely examined regularly to ensure that there are no exposed steel belts/wires.
• Care should be taken so that the tire does not collect water and debris; for example, providing drainage holes on the underside of the tire would reduce water collection.
• Recycled tire rubber mulch products should be inspected before installation to ensure that all metal has been removed.
In some situations, plastic materials can be used as an alter- native to simulate actual automobile tires.

              4. MAINTAINING A PLAYGROUND
Inadequate maintenance of equipment has resulted in injuries on playgrounds. Because the safety of playground equipment and its suitability for use depend on good inspection and maintenance, the manufacturer’s maintenance instructions and recommended inspection schedules should be strictly fol- lowed. If manufacturer’s recommendations are not available, a maintenance schedule should be developed based on actual or anticipated playground use. Frequently used playgrounds will require more frequent inspections and maintenance.
4.1 Maintenance Inspections
A comprehensive maintenance program should be developed for each playground. All playground areas and equipment should be inspected for excessive wear, deterioration, and any potential hazards, such as those shown in Table 3. One possible procedure is the use of checklists. Some manufactur- ers supply checklists for general or detailed inspections with their maintenance instructions. These can be used to ensure that inspections are in compliance with the manufacturer’s specifications. If manufacturer-provided inspection guide- lines are not available, a general checklist that may be used as a guide for frequent routine inspections of public play- grounds is included at Appendix A. This is intended to address only general maintenance concerns. Detailed inspec- tions should give special attention to moving parts and other parts that can be expected to wear. Maintenance inspections should be carried out in a systematic manner by personnel familiar with the playground, such as maintenance workers, playground supervisors, etc.
4.2 Repairs
Inspections alone do not constitute a comprehensive mainte- nance program. Any problems found during the inspection should be noted and fixed as soon as possible.
• All repairs and replacements of equipment parts should be completed following the manufacturer’s instructions.
• User modifications, such as loose-ended ropes tied to elevated parts, should be removed immediately.
• For each piece of equipment, the frequency of thorough
inspections will depend on the type and age of equipment, the amount of use, and the local climate.
• Consult the manufacturer for maintenance schedules for each piece of equipment. Based on these schedules, a maintenance schedule for the entire playground can be created. This routine maintenance schedule should not replace regular inspections.
4.3 Maintaining Loose-Fill Surfacing
Loose-fill surfacing materials require special maintenance. High-use public playgrounds, such as child care centers and schools, should be checked frequently to ensure surfacing has not displaced significantly, particularly in areas of the playground most subject to displacement (e.g., under swings and slide exits). This can be facilitated by marking ideal surfacing depths on equipment posts. Displaced loose-fill
 1

surfacing should be raked back into proper place so that a constant depth is maintained throughout the playground. Impact attenuating mats placed in high traffic areas, such as under swings and at slide exits, can significantly reduce displacement. They should be installed below or level with surfacing so as not to be a tripping hazard.
The following are key points to look for during regular checks of surfacing:
• Areas under swings and at slide exits. Activity in these areas tends to displace surfacing quickly. Rake loose-fill back into place.
• Pooling water on mulch surfacing. For example, wet mulch compacts faster than dry, fluffy mulch. If puddles are noticed regularly, consider addressing larger drainage issues.
• Frozen surfacing. Most loose-fill surfacing that freezes
solid no longer functions as protective surfacing. Even if the first few inches may be loose, the base layer may be frozen and the impact attenuation of the surfacing may be significantly reduced. It is recommended that children not play on the equipment under these conditions.
4.4 Recordkeeping
Records of all maintenance inspections and repairs should be retained, including the manufacturer’s maintenance instruc- tions and any checklists used. When any inspection is per- formed, the person performing it should sign and date the form used. A record of any accident and injury reported to have occurred on the playground should also be retained. This will help identify potential hazards or dangerous design features that should be corrected.

 5. PARTS OF THE PLAYGROUND
5.1 Platforms, Guardrails and Protective Barriers
5.1.1 Platforms
• Platforms should be generally flat (i.e., within ± 2° of horizontal).
• Openings in platforms should be provided to allow for drainage.
• Platforms should minimize the collection of debris.
• Platforms intended for toddlers should be no more than 32 inches from the ground.
5.1.2 Stepped platforms
On some composite structures, platforms are layered or tiered so that a child may access the higher platform without steps or ladders. Unless there is an alternate means of access/egress, the maximum difference in height between stepped platforms should be:
• Toddlers: 7 inches.
• Preschool-age: 12 inches. • School-age: 18 inches.
An access component (such as a rung) is needed if the difference in height is more than 12 inches for preschool-age and 18 inches for school-age children.
The space between the stepped platforms should follow the recommendations to minimize entrapment hazards in enclosed openings:
• Toddlers: if the space is less than 7 inches, infill should be used to reduce the space to less than 3.0 inches.
• Preschool-age: if the space exceeds 9 inches and the height of the lower platform above the protective surfacing exceeds 30 inches, infill should be used to reduce the space to less than 3.5 inches.
• School-age: if the space exceeds 9 inches and the height of the lower platform above the protective surfacing exceeds 48 inches, infill should be used to reduce the space to less than 3.5 inches.
5.1.2.1 Fall height
• The fall height of a platform is the distance between the top of the platform and the protective surfacing beneath it.
5.1.3 Guardrails and protective barriers
Guardrails and protective barriers are used to minimize the likelihood of accidental falls from elevated platforms. Protective barriers provide greater protection than guardrails and should be designed to discourage children from climbing over or through the barrier. Guardrails and barriers should:
• Completely surround any elevated platform.
• Except for entrance and exit openings, the maximum clearance opening without a top horizontal guardrail should be 15 inches.
• Prevent unintentional falls from the platform.
• Prevent the possibility of entrapment.
• Facilitate supervision. For example:
• Guardrails may have a horizontal top rail with infill consisting of vertical bars having openings that are greater than 9 inches. These openings do not present an entrap- ment hazard but do not prevent a child from climbing through the openings.
• A barrier should minimize the likelihood of passage of a child during deliberate attempts to defeat the barrier. Any openings between uprights or between the platform sur- face and lower edge of a protective barrier should prevent passage of the small torso template (see test in B.2.5).
Guardrails or protective barriers should be provided on elevated platforms, walkways, landings, stairways, and transi- tional surfaces. In general, the younger the child, the less coordination and balance they have, therefore the more vul- nerable they are to unintentional falls. Toddlers are the most vulnerable, and equipment intended for this age should use barriers on all elevated walking surfaces above 18 inches. Physical skills develop further in preschool-age children and then more with school-age children; therefore, minimum elevation recommendations for guardrails and barriers increase with each age group.
 20

Handbook for Public Playground Safety
 Guardrails and barriers should be high enough to prevent the tallest children from falling over the top. For guardrails, the lower edge should be low enough so that the smallest children cannot walk under it. Barriers should be low enough to prevent the smallest child from getting under the barrier in any way. This is generally done by designing the barrier so that the small torso probe (see test methods in Appendix B) cannot pass under or through the barrier. Vertical infill for protective barriers may be preferable for younger children because the vertical components can be grasped at whatever height a child chooses as a handhold.
Guardrail and barrier recommendations are shown in Table 4. However, the recommendations do not apply if the guardrail or barrier would interfere with the intended use of the equipment, such as:
• Climbing equipment
• Platforms layered so that the fall height is: – Toddlers: 7 inches or less.
– Preschool-age: 20 inches or less. – School-age: 30 inches or less.

 5.2 Access Methods to Play Equipment
Access to playground equipment can take many forms, such as conventional ramps, stairways with steps, and ladders with steps or rungs. Access may also be by means of climbing components, such as arch climbers, climbing nets, and tire climbers (see Figure 6).
As children develop, they gain better balance and coordina- tion, so it is important to pick appropriate access methods based on the age group. Table 5 shows the most common methods of access and the youngest appropriate age group.
Access to platforms over 6 feet high (except for free-stand- ing slides) should provide an intermediate standing surface so that the child can pause and make a decision to keep going up or find another way down. Children generally mas- ter access before egress, that is, they can go up before they can get back down a difficult component. Therefore, if there are more difficult access methods, it is important to have easier components for egress.
 22

Handbook for Public Playground Safety
 5.2.1 Ramps, stairways, rung ladders, and step ladders
Ramps, stairways, rung ladders, and step ladders each have different recommendations for slope and tread dimension, but the steps or rungs always should be evenly spaced - even the spacing between the top step or rung and the surface of the platform. Table 6 contains recommended dimensions for: access slope; tread or rung width; tread depth; rung diame- ter; and vertical rise for rung ladders, step ladders, and stair- ways. Table 6 also contains slope and width recommenda- tions for ramps. However, these recommendations are not intended to address ramps designed for access by wheel- chairs.
• Openings between steps or rungs and between the top step or rung and underside of a platform should prevent entrapment.
• When risers are closed, treads on stairways and ladders should prevent the accumulation of sand, water, or other materials on or between steps.
• Climbing equipment should allow children to descend as easily as they ascend. One way of implementing this rec- ommendation is to provide an easier, alternate means of descent, such as another mode of egress, a platform, or another piece of equipment. For example, a stairway can be added to provide a less challenging mode of descent than a vertical rung ladder or flexible climbing device (see Table 5).
• For toddlers and preschool-age children, offering an easy way out is particularly important since their ability to descend climbing components develops later than their ability to climb up the same components.

Handbook for Public Playground Safety
 5.2.2 Rungs and other hand gripping components
Unlike steps of stairways and step ladders that are primarily for foot support, rungs can be used for both foot and hand support.
• Rungs with round shapes are easiest for children to grip.
• All hand grips should be secured in a manner that pre- vents them from turning.
• Toddlers:
– Handrails or other means of hand support should have a diameter or maximum cross-section between 0.60 and 1.20 inches.
– A diameter or maximum cross-section of 0.90 inches is preferred to achieve maximal grip strength and benefit the weakest children.
• Preschool- and school-age:
– Rungs, handrails, climbing bars, or other means of hand support intended for holding should have a diameter or maximum cross-section between 0.95 and 1.55 inches.
– A diameter or maximum cross-section of 1.25 inches is preferred to achieve maximal grip strength and benefit the weakest children.
5.2.3 Handrails
Handrails on stairways and step ladders are intended to pro- vide hand support and to steady the user. Continuous handrails extending over the full length of the access should be provided on both sides of all stairways and step ladders, regardless of the height of the access. Rung ladders do not require handrails since rungs or side supports provide hand support on these more steeply inclined accesses.
5.2.3.1 Handrail height
Handrails should be available for use at the appropriate height, beginning with the first step. The vertical distance between the top front edge of a step or ramp surface and the top surface of the handrail above it should be as follows:
• Toddlers: between 15 and 20 inches.
• Preschool-age: between 22 and 26 inches. • School-age: between 22 and 38 inches.
5.2.4 Transition from access to platform
Handrails or handholds are recommended at all transition points (the point where the child must move from the access component to the play structure platform).
• The handhold should provide support from the access component until the child has fully achieved the desired posture on the platform.
• Any opening between a handrail and an adjacent vertical structure (e.g., vertical support post for a platform or ver- tical slat of a protective barrier) should not pose an entrapment hazard.
• Access methods that do not have handrails, such as rung ladders, flexible climbers, arch climbers, and tire climbers, should provide hand supports for the transition between the top of the access and the platform.
5.3 Major Types of Playground Equipment
5.3.1 Balance beams
• Balance beams should be no higher than: • Toddlers: not recommended.
• Preschool-age: 12 inches.
• School-age: 16 inches.
5.3.1.1 Fall height
The fall height of a balance beam is the distance between the top of the walking surface and the protective surfacing beneath it.
5.3.2 Climbing and upper body equipment
Climbing equipment is generally designed to present a greater degree of physical challenge than other equipment on public playgrounds. This type of equipment requires the use of the hands to navigate up or across the equipment. “Climbers” refers to a wide variety of equipment, such as but not limited to:
• Arch climbers
• Dome climbers
• Flexible climbers (usually chain or net) • Parallel bars
• Sliding poles
 2

Handbook for Public Playground Safety
   Simple Arch Climber
 Geodesic Dome Climber
 Overhead Horizontal Ladder
 Overhead Loop Ladder
Figure 7. Examples of climbers
• Spiral climbers
• Upper body equipment (horizontal overhead ladders, overhead rings, track ride).
School-age children tend to use climbing and upper body equipment more frequently and more proficiently than preschool children. Young preschool children may have diffi- culty using some climbers because they have not yet devel- oped some of the physical skills necessary for certain climb- ing activities (balance, coordination, and upper body strength). Older preschool children (i.e., 4- and 5-year-olds) are beginning to use flexible climbers, arch climbers, and upper body devices.
5.3.2.1 Design considerations
5.3.2.1.1 Layout of climbing components
When climbing components are part of a composite struc- ture, their level of challenge and method of use should be compatible with the traffic flow from nearby components. Upper body devices should be placed so that the swinging movement generated by children on this equipment cannot interfere with the movement of children on adjacent struc- tures, particularly children descending on slides. The design of adjacent play structures should not facilitate climbing to the top support bars of upper body equipment.
5.3.2.1.2 Fall Height
Climbers:
• Unless otherwise specified in this section, the fall height for climbers is the distance between the highest part of the climbing component and the protective surfacing beneath it.
• If the climber is part of a composite structure, the fall height is the distance between the highest part of the climber intended for foot support and the protective surfacing beneath it.
– Toddlers: The maximum fall height for free standing and composite climbing structures should be 32 inches.
Upper Body Equipment:
• The fall height of upper body equipment is the distance between the highest part of the equipment and the pro- tective surface below.
5.3.2.1.3 Climbing rungs
Some of the access methods discussed in §5.2 are also con- sidered climbing devices; therefore, the recommendations for the size of climbing rungs are similar.
 25

Handbook for Public Playground Safety
               6’
    6’
 6’
   Figure 8. Use zone surrounding a freestanding arch climber
6’
• Rungs should be generally round.
• All rungs should be secured in a manner that prevents them from turning.
• Climbing rungs should follow the same diameter recom- mendations as in §5.2.2.
5.3.2.1.4 Use zone
• The use zone should extend a minimum of 6 feet in all directions from the perimeter of the stand alone climber. See Figure 8.
• The use zone of a climber may overlap with neighboring equipment if the other piece of equipment allows overlapping use zones and
– There is at least 6 feet between equipment when adjacent designated play surfaces are no more than 30 inches high; or
– There is at least 9 feet between equipment when adjacent designated play surfaces are more than 30 inches high.
5.3.2.1.5 Other considerations
• Climbers should not have climbing bars or other rigid structural components in the interior of the climber onto
which a child may fall from a height of greater than 18 inches. See Figure 9 for an example of a climber that DOES NOT follow this consideration.
  Figure 9: Climber with rigid structural components that DOES NOT meet 5.3.2.1.5
 2

Handbook for Public Playground Safety
    Figure 12. Examples of two- and three-dimensional flexible climbers
5.3.2.2 Arch climbers
Arch climbers consist of rungs attached to convex side sup- ports. They may be free standing (Figure 10) or be provided as a more challenging means of access to other equipment (Figure 11).
• Arch climbers should not be used as the sole means of access to other equipment for preschoolers.
• Free standing arch climbers are not recommended for tod- dlers or preschool-age children.
• The rung diameter and spacing of rungs on arch climbers should follow the recommendations for rung ladders in Table 6.
  Figure 10. Freestanding arch climber
5.3.2.3 Flexible climbers
Flexible climbers use a grid of ropes, chains, cables, or tires for climbing. Since the flexible parts do not provide a steady means of support, flexible climbers require more advanced balance abilities than rigid climbers.
Rope, chain, and cable generally form a net-like structure that may be either two or three dimensional. See Figure 12. Tire climbers may have the tires secured tread-to-tread to form a sloping grid, or the tires may be suspended individual- ly by chains or other means.
• Flexible climbers that provide access to platforms should be securely anchored at both ends.
• When connected to the ground, the anchoring devices should be installed below ground level and beneath the base of the protective surfacing material.
• Connections between ropes, cables, chains, or between tires should be securely fixed.
• Flexible climbers are not recommended as the sole means of access to equipment intended for toddlers and preschool-age children.
• Free-standing flexible climbers are not recommended on playgrounds intended for toddlers and preschool children.
• Spacing between the horizontal and vertical components of a climbing grid should not form entrapment hazards.
• The perimeter of any opening in a net structure should be less than 17 inches or greater than 28 inches (see Figure 13).
  Figure 11. Arch climber access

Should be less than 17 inches or greater than 28 inches
                Figure 13. Entrapment hazards in flexible climbers
5.3.2. Horizontal (overhead) ladders
Horizontal (overhead) ladders are a type of climber designed to build upper body strength. They are designed to allow children to move across the ladder from end to end using only their hands.
Four-year-olds are generally the youngest children able to use upper body devices like these; therefore, horizontal lad- ders should not be used on playgrounds intended for toddlers and 3-year-olds. The recommendations below are designed to accommodate children ages 4 through 12 years.
• The first handhold on either end of upper body equip- ment should not be placed directly above the platform or climbing rung used for mount or dismount. This minimizes the risk of children impacting rigid access structures if they fall from the first handhold during mount or dismount.
• The horizontal distance out to the first handhold should be:
– No greater than 10 inches but not directly above the platform when access is from a platform.
– At least 8 inches but no greater than 10 inches when access is from climbing rungs.
• The space between adjacent rungs of overhead ladders should be greater than 9 inches to prevent entrapment.
• Horizontal ladders intended for preschool-age children should have rungs that are parallel to one another and evenly spaced.
• The maximum height of a horizontal ladder (i.e., mea- sured from the center of the grasping device to the top of the protective surfacing below) should be:
– Preschool-age (4 and 5 years): no more than 60 inches. – School-age: no more than 84 inches.
• The center-to-center spacing of horizontal ladder rungs should be as follows:
– Preschool-age (4 and 5 years): no more than 12 inches. – School-age: no more than 15 inches.
• The maximum height of the take-off/landing platform above the protective surfacing should be:
– Preschool-age (4 and 5 years): no more than 18 inches. – School-age: no more than 36 inches.
 2

5.3.2.5 Overhead rings
Overhead rings are similar to horizontal ladders in terms of the complexity of use. Therefore, overhead rings should not be used on playgrounds intended for toddlers and 3-year- olds. The recommendations below are designed to accommo- date children 4 through 12 years of age.
Overhead rings differ from horizontal ladders because, dur- ing use, the gripped ring swings through an arc and reduces the distance to the gripping surface of the next ring; there- fore, the spacing distance recommendations for horizontal ladders do not apply.
• The first handhold on either end of upper body equipment should not be placed directly above the platform or climb- ing rung used for mount or dismount. This minimizes the risk of children hitting rigid access structures if they fall from the first handhold during mount or dismount.
• The horizontal distance out to the first handhold should be:
– No greater than 10 inches but not directly above the platform when access is from a platform.
– At least 8 inches but no greater than 10 inches when access is from climbing rungs.
• The maximum height of overhead rings measured from the center of the grasping device to the protective surfac- ing should be:
– Preschool-age (4 and 5 years): 60 inches. – School-age: 84 inches.
• If overhead swinging rings are suspended by chains, the maximum length of the chains should be 7 inches.
• The maximum height of the take-off/landing platform above the protective surfacing should be:
– Preschool-age (4 and 5 years): no more than 18 inches. – School-age: no more than 36 inches.
5.3.2. Sliding poles
Vertical sliding poles are more challenging than some other types of climbing equipment. They require upper body strength and coordination to successfully slide down the pole. Unlike other egress methods, there is no reverse or stop, so a child cannot change his or her mind. Children who start a sliding pole must have the strength to slide the whole way or they will fall.
• Sliding poles are not recommended for toddlers or preschool-age children since they generally don't have the upper body and/or hand strength to slide.
• Sliding poles should be continuous with no protruding welds or seams along the sliding surface.
• The pole should not change direction along the sliding portion.
• The horizontal distance between a sliding pole and any structure used for access to the sliding pole should be between 18 inches and 20 inches.
• The pole should extend at least 60 inches above the level of the platform or structure used for access to the sliding pole.
• The diameter of sliding poles should be no greater than 1.9 inches.
• Sliding poles and their access structures should be located so that traffic from other events will not interfere with the users during descent.
• Upper access should be on one level only.
• The upper access area through the guardrail or barrier should be 15 inches wide at most.
5.3.2.6.1 Fall height
• For sliding poles accessed from platforms, the fall height is the distance between the platform and the protective sur- facing beneath it.
• For sliding poles not accessed from platforms, the fall height is the distance between a point 60 inches below the highest point of the pole and the protective surfacing beneath it.
• The top of the sliding pole’s support structure should not be a designated play surface.
5.3.2. Track rides
Track rides are a form of upper body equipment where the child holds on to a handle or other device that slides along a track above his or her head. The child then lifts his or her feet and is carried along the length of the track. Track rides require significant upper body strength and the judgment to know when it is safe to let go. These are skills not developed until children are at least school-age; therefore, CPSC staff recommends:
• Track rides should not be used on playgrounds for toddlers and preschool-age children.
• Track rides should not have any obstacles along the path of the ride, including anything that would interfere in the take-off or landing areas.
Handbook for Public Playground Safety
  29

Handbook for Public Playground Safety
   Figure 14. Log roll
• Two track rides next to each other should be at least 4 feet apart.
• The handle should be between 64 inches and 78 inches from the surfacing and follow the gripping recommenda- tions in §5.2.2.
• Nothing should ever be tied or attached to any moving part of a track ride.
• Rolling parts should be enclosed to prevent crush hazards.
5.3.2.7.1 Fall height
• The fall height of track ride equipment is the distance between the maximum height of the equipment and the protective surface beneath it.
• Equipment support posts with no designated play surfaces are exempt from this requirement.
5.3.3 Log rolls
Log rolls help older children master balance skills and increase strength. Children must balance on top of the log as they spin it with their feet. See Figure 14.
• Log rolls are not recommended for toddlers and preschool-age children. These children generally do not possess the balance, coordination, and strength to use a log roll safely.
• Log rolls should have handholds to assist with balance.
• The handholds should follow the guidelines in §5.2.2.
• The highest point of the rolling log should be a maximum of 18 inches above the protective surface below.
• When not part of a composite structure, the use zone may overlap with neighboring equipment if the other piece of equipment allows overlapping use zones (see §5.3.9) and
– There is at least 6 feet between equipment when adjacent designated play surfaces are no more than 30 inches high; or
– There is at least 9 feet between equipment when adjacent designated play surfaces are more than 30 inches high.
5.3.3.1.1 Fall height
The fall height of a log roll is the distance between the highest portion of the rolling log and the protective surfacing beneath it.
5.3.4 Merry-go-rounds
Merry-go-rounds are the most common rotating equipment found on public playgrounds. Children usually sit or stand on the platform while other children or adults push the merry- go-round to make it rotate. In addition, children often get on and off the merry-go-round while it is in motion. Merry-go- rounds may present a physical hazard to preschool-age chil- dren who have little or no control over such products once they are in motion. Therefore, children in this age group should always be supervised when using merry-go-rounds.
The following recommendations apply when the merry-go- round is at least 20 inches in diameter.
• Merry-go-rounds should not be used on playgrounds intended for toddlers.
• The standing/sitting surface of the platform should have a maximum height of:
– Preschool: 14 inches above the protective surface. – School-age: 18 inches above the protective surface.
• The rotating platform should be continuous and approximately circular.
• The surface of the platform should not have any openings between the axis and the periphery that permit a rod hav- ing a diameter of 5/16 inch to penetrate completely through the surface.
 30

• The difference between the minimum and maximum radii of a non-circular platform should not exceed 2.0 inches (Figure 15).
5.3..2 Fall height
The fall height for a merry-go-round is the distance between the perimeter of the platform where a child could sit or stand and the protective surfacing beneath it.
5.3.5 Seesaws
5.3.5.1 Fulcrum seesaws
The typical seesaw (also known as a “teeter totter”) consists of a board or pole with a seat at each end supported at the center by a fulcrum. See Figure 16. Because of the complex way children are required to cooperate and combine their actions, fulcrum seesaws are not recommended for toddlers or preschool-age children.

 The difference between dimensions AC and AB should not exceed 2.0 inches.

Figure 16. Typical Fulcrum Seesaw
• The underside of the perimeter of the platform should be no less than 9 inches above the level of the protective surfacing beneath it.
• There should not be any accessible shearing or crushing mechanisms in the undercarriage of the equipment.
• Children should be provided with a secure means of hold- ing on. Where handgrips are provided, they should con- form to the general recommendations for hand gripping components in §5.2.2.
• No components of the apparatus, including handgrips, should extend beyond the perimeter of the platform.
• The rotating platform of a merry-go-round should not have any sharp edges.
• A means should be provided to limit the peripheral speed of rotation to a maximum of 13 ft/sec.
• Merry-go-round platforms should not have any up and down (oscillatory) motion.
5.3..1 Use zone
• The use zone should extend a minimum of 6 feet beyond the perimeter of the platform.
• The use zone may not overlap other use zones, unless the rotating equipment is less than 20 inches in diameter and the adjacent equipment allows overlap.
• The fulcrum should not present a crush hazard.
• Partial car tires, or some other shock-absorbing material, should be embedded in the ground underneath the seats, or secured on the underside of the seats. This will help prevent limbs from being crushed between the seat and the ground, as well as cushion the impact.
• The maximum attainable angle between a line connecting the seats and the horizontal is 25°.
• There should not be any footrests.
5.3.5.2 Spring-centered seesaws
Preschool-age children are capable of using spring-centered seesaws because the centering device prevents abrupt con- tact with the ground if one child dismounts suddenly. Spring-centered seesaws also have the advantage of not requiring two children to coordinate their actions in order to play safely. Spring-centered seesaws should follow the recom- mendations for spring rockers including the use of footrests (§5.3.7).
 31

Handbook for Public Playground Safety
  5.3.5.3 Use zone for fulcrum and spring-centered seesaws
• The use zone should extend a minimum of 6 feet from each outside edge of the seesaw.
• The use zone may overlap with neighboring equipment if the other piece of equipment allows overlapping use zones and
– There is at least 6 feet between equipment when adjacent designated play surfaces are no more than 30 inches high; or
– There is at least 9 feet between equipment when adjacent designated play surfaces are more than 30 inches high.
5.3.5. Handholds
• Handholds should be provided at each seating position for gripping with both hands and should not turn when grasped.
• Handholds should not protrude beyond the sides of the seat.
5.3.5.5 Fall height
The fall height for a seesaw is the distance between the highest point any part of the seesaw can reach and the protective surfacing beneath it.
5.3.6 Slides
Children can be expected to descend slide chutes in many dif- ferent positions, rather than always sitting and facing forward as they slide. These other posi- tions should be discouraged at all times to minimize injuries.
Slides may provide a straight, wavy, or spiral descent either by means of a tube or an open slide chute. They may be either free-standing (Figure 17), part of a composite struc- ture, or built on the grade of a natural or man-made slope (embankment slide). Regardless of the type of slide, avoid using bare metals on the platforms, chutes, and steps. When exposed to direct sunlight the bare metal may reach temper- atures high enough to cause serious contact burn injuries in a matter of seconds. Provide shade for bare metal slides or use other materials that may reduce the surface temperature such as, but not limited to, plastic or coated metal.
5.3..1 Slide access
Access to a stand-alone slide generally is by means of a ladder with rungs, steps, or a stairway with steps. Slides may also be part of a composite play structure, so children will gain access from other parts of the structure. Embankment slides use the ground for access.

5.3..2 Slide platform
All slides should be provided with a platform with sufficient length to facilitate the transition from standing to sitting at the top of the inclined sliding surface. Embankment slides are exempt from platform requirements because they are on ground level; however, they should not have any spaces or gaps as noted below.
The platform should:
• Be at least 19 inches deep for toddlers.
• Be at least 14 inches deep for preschool-age and school-age children.
• Be horizontal.
• Be at least as wide as the slide chute.
• Be surrounded by guardrails or barriers.
• Conform to the same recommendations as general platforms given in §5.1.1.
• Not have any spaces or gaps that could trap strings, clothing, body parts, etc. between the platform and the start of the slide chute.
• Provide handholds to facilitate the transition from standing to sitting and decrease the risk of falls (except tube slides where the tube perimeter provides hand support). These should extend high enough to provide hand support for the largest child in a standing position, and low enough to provide hand support for the smallest child in a sitting position.
• Provide a means to channel a user into a sitting position at the entrance to the chute, such as a guardrail, hood, or other device that discourages climbing.
5.3..3 Slide chutes
5.3.6.3.1 Embankment slides
• The slide chute of an embankment slide should have a maximum height of 12 inches above the underlying ground surface. This design basically eliminates the hazard of falls from elevated heights.
• Embankment slides should follow all of the recommenda- tions given for straight slides where applicable (e.g., side height, slope, use zone at exit, etc.).
• There should be some means provided at the slide chute entrance to minimize the use of embankment slides by children on skates, skateboards, or bicycles.
5.3.6.3.2 Roller slides
• Roller slides should meet applicable recommendations for other slides (e.g., side height, slope, use zone at exit, etc.).
• The space between adjacent rollers and between the ends of the rollers and the stationary structure should be less than 3/16 inch.
• Frequent inspections are recommended to insure that there are no missing rollers or broken bearings and that the rollers roll.
5.3.6.3.3 Spiral slides
• Spiral slides should follow the recommendations for straight slides where applicable (e.g., side height, slope, use zone at exit, etc.).
• Special attention should be given to design features which may present problems unique to spiral slides, such as lateral discharge of the user.
• Toddlers and preschool-age children have less ability to maintain balance and postural control, so only short spiral slides (one 360° turn or less) are recommended for these age groups.
5.3.6.3.4 Straight slides
• Flat open chutes should have sides at least 4 inches high extending along both sides of the chute for the entire length of the inclined sliding surface.
• The sides should be an integral part of the chute, without any gaps between the sides and the sliding surface. (This does not apply to roller slides).
• Slides may have an open chute with a circular, semicircu- lar or curved cross section provided that:
A. The vertical height of the sides is no less than 4 inches when measured at right angles to a horizontal line
that is 8 inches long when the slide is intended for toddlers, 12 inches long when the slide is intended for preschool-age children, and 16 inches long when the slide is intended for school-age children (Figure 18); or
B. For any age group, the vertical height of the sides is no less than 4 inches minus two times the width of the slide chute divided by the radius of the slide chute curvature (Figure 19).

 • For toddlers:
– The average incline of a slide chute should be no more than 24° (that is, the height to horizontal length ratio shown in Figure 20 does not exceed 0.445).
– No section of the slide chute should have a slope greater than 30°.
– The slide chute should be between 8 and 12 inches wide.
• For preschool- and school-age children:
– The average incline of a slide chute should be no more than 30° (that is, the height to horizontal length ratio shown in Figure 20 does not exceed 0.577).
– No section of the slide chute should have a slope greater than 50°.
5.3.6.3.5 Tube slides
• Tube slides should meet all the applicable recommenda- tions for other slides (e.g., side height, slope, use zone at exit, etc.).
• Means, such as barriers or textured surfaces, should be provided to prevent sliding or climbing on the top (outside) of the tube.
• The minimum internal diameter of the tube should be no less than 23 inches.
• Supervisors should be aware of children using tube slides since the children are not always visible.
5.3.. Chute exit region
All slides should have an exit region to help children main- tain their balance and facilitate a smooth transition from sit- ting to standing when exiting. The chute exit region should:
• Be between 0 and -4° as measured from a plane parallel to the ground.
• Have edges that are rounded or curved to prevent lacera- tions or other injuries that could result from impact with a sharp or straight edge.
• For toddlers the chute exit region should:
– Be between 7 and 10 inches long if any portion of the chute exceeds a 24° slope.
– Be no more than 6 inches above the protective surfacing.
– Have a transition from the sliding portion to the exit region with a radius of curvature of at least 18 inches.
• For preschool- and school-age the chute exit region should:
– Be at least 11 inches long.
– Be no more than 11 inches above the protective surfacing if the slide is no greater than 4 feet high.
– Be at least 7 inches but not more than 15 inches above the protective surfacing if the slide is over 4 feet high.

5.3..5 Slide use zone
Toddlers:
• In a limited access environment
– The use zone should be at least 3 feet around the perimeter of the slide.
– The area at the end of the slide should not overlap with the use zone for any other equipment.
• In public areas with unlimited access
– For a stand-alone slide, the use zone should be at least 6 feet around the perimeter.
– For slides that are part of a composite structure, the minimum use zone between the access components and the side of the slide chute should be 3 feet.
– The use zone at the end of the slide should be at least 6 feet from the end of the slide and not overlap with the use zone for any other equipment.
Preschool- and school-age (see Figure 21):
• The use zone in front of the access and to the sides of a slide should extend a minimum of 6 feet from the perime- ter of the equipment. This recommendation does not apply to embankment slides or slides that are part of a composite structure (see §5.3.9).
• The use zone in front of the exit of a slide should never overlap the use zone of any other equipment; however, two or more slide use zones may overlap if their sliding paths are parallel.
• For slides less than or equal to 6 feet high, the use zone in front of the exit should be at least 6 feet.
• For slides greater than 6 feet high, the use zone in front of the exit should be at least as long as the slide is high up to a maximum of 8 feet.
5.3.. Fall height
The fall height for slides is the distance between the transi- tion platform and the protective surfacing beneath it.
5.3.. Entanglement hazard
Children have suffered serious injuries and died by getting parts of their clothing tangled on protrusions or gaps on slides.
To reduce the chance of clothing entanglement:
• Projections up to 3 inches in diameter should not stick up more than 1/8 inch from the slide.
• There should be no gaps at the tops of slides where the slide chute connects with the platform that can entangle clothing or strings.
• See Appendix B for full recommendations and details of the protrusion test procedure.
5.3.. Other sliding equipment
Equipment where it is foreseeable that a primary use of the component is sliding should follow the same guidelines for entanglement that are in 5.3.6.7.
5.3.7 Spring rockers
Toddlers and preschool-age children enjoy the bouncing and rocking activities presented by spring rockers, and they are the primary users of rocking equipment. See Figure 22. Older children may not find it challenging enough.
• Seat design should not allow the rocker to be used by more than the intended number of users.
 3

Handbook for Public Playground Safety
   Figure 22. Example of spring rocker
• For toddlers:
– The seat should be between 12 and 16 inches high.
– Spring rockers with opposing seats intended for more than one child should have at least 37 inches between the seat centers.
• For preschoolers:
– The seat should be between 14 and 28 inches high.
• Each seating position should be equipped with handgrips and footrests. The diameter of handgrips should follow the recommendations for hand gripping components in §5.2.2.
• The springs of rocking equipment should minimize the possibility of children crushing their hands or their feet between coils or between the spring and a part of the rocker.
• The use zone should extend a minimum of 6 feet from the “at rest” perimeter of the equipment.
• The use zone may overlap with neighboring equipment if the other piece of equipment allows overlapping use zones and
– There is at least 6 feet between equipment when adjacent designated play surfaces are no more than 30 inches high; or
– There is at least 9 feet between equipment when adjacent designated play surfaces are more than 30 inches high; and
– The spring rocker is designed to be used from a seated position.
5.3..1 Fall height
The fall height of spring rockers is the distance between either (1) the highest designated playing surface or (2) the seat, whichever is higher, and the protective surfacing beneath it.
5.3.8 Swings
Children of all ages generally enjoy the sensations created while swinging. Mostly they sit on the swings; however, it is common to see children jumping off swings. Younger children also tend to swing on their stomachs, and older children may stand on the seats. To prevent injuries, these behaviors should be discouraged.
Swings may be divided into two distinct types:
• Single axis: Sometimes called a to-fro swing. A single-axis swing is intended to swing back and forth in a single plane and generally consists of a seat supported by at least two suspending members, each of which is connected to a separate pivot on an overhead structure.
• Multi-axis: A multi-axis swing consists of a seat (generally a tire) suspended from a single pivot that permits it to swing in any direction.
5.3..1 General swing recommendations
• Hardware used to secure the suspending elements to the swing seat and to the supporting structure should not be removable without the use of tools.
• S-hooks are often part of a swing’s suspension system, either attaching the suspending elements to the overhead support bar or to the swing seat. Open S-hooks can catch a child’s clothing and present a strangulation hazard. S- hooks should be pinched closed. An S-hook is considered closed if there is no gap or space greater than 0.04 inches (about the thickness of a dime).
• Swings should be suspended from support structures that discourage climbing.
• A-frame support structures should not have horizontal cross-bars.

• Fiber ropes are not recommended as a means of suspend- ing swings since they may degrade over time.
• Swing structures should be located away from other equipment or activities to help prevent young children from inadvertently running into the path of moving swings. Additional protection can be provided by means of a low blockade such as a fence or hedge around the perimeter of the swing area. The blockade should not be an obstacle within the use zone of a swing structure or hamper supervision by blocking visibility.
5.3..2 Fall height
The fall height for swings is the vertical distance between the pivot point and the protective surfacing beneath it.
5.3..3 Single-axis swings
5.3.8.3.1 Belt seats used without adult assistance
• The use zone to the front and rear of single-axis swings should never overlap the use zone of another piece of equipment.
• To minimize the likelihood of children being struck by a moving swing, it is recommended that no more than two single-axis swings be hung in each bay of the supporting structure.
 3

Handbook for Public Playground Safety
 • Swings should not be attached to composite structures.
• Swing seats should be designed to accommodate no more than one user at any time.
• Lightweight rubber or plastic swing seats are recommend- ed to help reduce the severity of impact injuries. Wood or metal swing seats should be avoided.
• Edges of seats should have smoothly finished or rounded edges and should conform to the protrusion recommenda- tions in 5.3.8.5.
• If loose-fill material is used as a protective surfacing, the height recommendations should be determined after the material has been compressed.
5.3.8.3.2 Full bucket seat swings
Full bucket seat swings are similar to single-axis swings since they move in a to-fro direction. However, full bucket seat swings are intended for children under 4 years of age to use with adult assistance.
• The seats and suspension systems of these swings, includ- ing the related hardware, should follow all of the criteria for conventional single axis swings.
• Full bucket seats are recommended to provide support on all sides of a child and between the legs of the occupant (see Figure 24).
• The full bucket seat materials should not present a stran- gulation hazard, such as might be presented with a rope or chain used as part of the seat.
• Openings in swing seats should conform to the entrap- ment criteria in §3.3.
• Full bucket seat swings should be suspended from structures that are separate from those for other swings, or at least suspended from a separate bay of the same structure.
• Full bucket seat swings should not allow the child to enter and exit alone.
• Pivot points should be more than 47 inches but no more than 96 inches above the protective surfacing.
5.3.8.3.3 Use zone for single-axis swings – belt and full bucket
The use zone in front of and behind the swing should be greater than to the sides of such a swing since children may deliberately attempt to exit from a single-axis swing while it is in motion. See Figure 25.
• The use zone for a belt swing should extend to the front and rear of a single-axis swing a minimum distance of twice the vertical distance from the pivot point and the top of the protective surface beneath it.
• The use zone for a full bucket swing should extend to the front and rear a minimum of twice the vertical distance from the top of the occupant’s sitting surface to the pivot point.
• The use zone in front of and behind swings should never overlap with any other use zone.
• The use zone to the sides of a single-axis swing should extend a minimum of 6 feet from the perimeter of the swing. This 6-foot zone may overlap that of an adjacent swing structure or other playground equipment structure.
5.3.. Multi-axis (tire) swings
Tire swings are usually suspended in a horizontal orientation using three suspension chains or cables connected to a single swivel mechanism that permits both rotation and swinging motion in any axis.
• A multi-axis tire swing should not be suspended from a structure having other swings in the same bay.
• Attaching multi-axis swings to composite structures is not recommended.
  Figure 24. Example of full bucket seat swings
 39

Handbook for Public Playground Safety
 • To minimize the hazard of impact, heavy truck tires should be avoided. Further, if steel-belted radials are used, they should be closely examined to ensure that there are no exposed steel belts or wires that could be a potential protrusion or laceration hazard. Plastic materials can be used as an alternative to simulate actual automobile tires. Drainage holes should be provided in the underside of the tire.
• Pay special attention to maintenance of the hanger mech- anism because the likelihood of failure is higher for tire swings due to the added stress of rotational movement and multiple occupants.
• The hanger mechanisms for multi-axis tire swings should not have any accessible crush points.
• The minimum clearance between the seating surface of a tire swing and the uprights of the supporting structure should be 30 inches when the tire is in a position closest to the support structure (Figure 26).
• The minimum clearance between the bottom of the seat and the protective surface should not be less than 12 inches.
5.3.8.4.1 Multi-axis swing use zones
• The use zone should extend in any direction from a point directly beneath the pivot point for a minimum distance of 6 feet plus the length of the suspending members (see Figure 27). This use zone should never overlap the use zone of any other equipment.

 • The use zone should extend a minimum of 6 feet from the perimeter of the supporting structure. This 6-foot zone may overlap that of an adjacent swing structure or other playground equipment structure.
5.3..5 Protrusions on suspended members of swing assemblies
Protrusions on swings are extremely hazardous because of the potential for impact incidents. Nothing, including bolts or other parts, on the front, back, or underside of a swing should stick out more than 1/8 of an inch. See test proce- dures in Appendix B.
5.3.9 Fall height and use zones for composite structure
When two or more complementary play components are linked together in a composite structure (e.g., combination climber, slide, and horizontal ladder), the use zone should extend a minimum of 6 feet from the external perimeter of the structure (see Figure 28). Where slides are attached to a platform higher than 6 feet from the protective surfacing, the use zone may need to extend further in front of the slide (see §5.3.6.5).
5.3.10 Fall height and use zones not specified elsewhere
Most playground equipment belongs in one of the categories listed above. If it does not, the following general recommen- dations should be applied:
• The fall height of a piece of playground equipment is the distance between the highest designated playing surface and the protective surface beneath it.
• The use zone should extend a minimum of 6 feet in all directions from the perimeter of the equipment.
• The use zones of two stationary pieces of playground equipment that are positioned adjacent to one another may overlap if the adjacent designated play surfaces of each structure are no more than 30 inches above the pro- tective surface and the equipment is at least 6 feet apart.
• If adjacent designated play surfaces on either structure exceed a height of 30 inches, the minimum distance between the structures should be 9 feet.
• Use zones should be free of obstacles.

B.2 Test Methods
B.2.1 Determining whether a projection is a protrusion
B.2.1.1 Test procedure
B.2.2 Projections on suspended members of swing assemblies
Given the potential for impact incidents, projections on swings can be extremely hazardous. A special test gauge (see Figure B2) and procedure are recommended. When tested, no bolts or components in the potential impact region on suspended members should extend through the hole beyond the face of the gauge.
Step 1: Step 2:
Successively place each projection test gauge (see Figure B1) over any projection
Visually determine if the projection penetrates through the hole and beyond the face of the gauge (see Figure B11 below).
Pass: A projection that does not extend beyond the face of the gauge passes.
Fail: A projection that extends beyond the face of any one of the gauges is considered a haz- ardous protrusion and should be eliminated.
B.2.2.1
Step 1:
Step 2: Step 3:
Test procedure
Hold the gauge (Figure B2) vertically with the axis through the hole parallel to the swing’s path of travel.
Place the gauge over any projections that are exposed during the swing’s path of travel.
Visually determine if the projection penetrates through the hole and beyond the face of the gauge.
Pass: A projection that does not extend beyond the face of the gauge passes.
Fail: A projection that extends beyond the face of the gauge is considered a hazardous protrusion and should be eliminated.

B.2.3 Projections on slides
To minimize the likelihood of clothing entanglement on slides, projections that (1) fit within any one of the three gauges shown in Figure B1 and (2) have a major axis that projects away from the slide bed should not have projections greater than 1/8 inch perpendicular to the plane of the sur- rounding surface (Figure B12).
B.2.3.1
Step 1: Step 2: Step 3:
Test procedure
Identify all projections within the shaded area shown in Figure B13.
Determine which, if any, fit inside the projection test gauges (Figure B1).
Place the swing and slide projection gauge (Figure B2) next to the projection to check the height of the projection.

B.2.4 Entrapment
B.2..1 General
Any completely-bounded opening (Figure B14) that is not bounded by the ground may be a potential head entrapment hazard. Even those openings which are low enough to permit a child’s feet to touch the ground present a risk of strangula- tion to an entrapped child, because younger children may not have the necessary intellectual ability and motor skills to withdraw their heads, especially if scared or panicked. An opening may present an entrapment hazard if the distance between any interior opposing surfaces is greater than 3.5 inches and less than 9 inches. If one dimension of an open- ing is within this potentially hazardous range, all dimensions of the opening should be considered together to fully evalu- ate the possibility of entrapment. The most appropriate method to determine whether an opening is hazardous is to test it using the following fixtures, methods, and perfor- mance criteria.
These recommendations apply to all playground equipment, i.e., toddler, preschool-age, and school-age children. Fixed equipment as well as moving equipment (in its stationary position) should be tested for entrapment hazards. There are two special cases for which separate procedures are given: (1) completely-bounded openings where depth of penetra- tion is a critical issue (see Figure B15) and (2) openings formed by flexible climbing components.

 B.2.5 Test fixtures
Two templates are required to determine if completely bounded openings in rigid structures present an entrapment hazard. These templates can easily be fabricated from card- board, plywood, or sheet metal.
B.2.5.1 Small torso template
The dimensions (see Figure B3 and Figure B4) of this tem- plate are based on the size of the torso of the smallest user at risk (5th percentile 6-month-old child for Figure B3 and 2- year-old child for Figure B4). If an opening is too small to admit the template, it is also too small to permit feet first entry by a child. Because children’s heads are larger than their torsos, an opening that does not admit the small torso template will also prevent head first entry into an opening by a child.
B.2.5.2 Large head template
The dimensions (see Figure B5) of this template are based on the largest dimension on the head of the largest child at risk (95th percentile 5-year-old child). If an opening is large enough to permit free passage of the template, it is large enough to permit free passage of the head of the largest child at risk in any orientation. Openings large enough to permit free passage of the large head template will not entrap the chest of the largest child at risk.
B.2.5.3 Completely bounded openings with unlimited depth
B.2.5.3.1 Test procedure
Step 4:
Determine if the small torso template can freely pass through the opening.
    Step 1:
Step 2: Step 3:
Select the appropriate small torso template based on the intended users of the playground (Figure B3 for toddler playgrounds, Figure B4 for preschool- and school-age playgrounds).
Identify all completely bounded openings.
Attempt to place the small torso template in the opening with the plane of the template parallel to the plane of the opening. While keeping it parallel to the plane of the opening, the template should be rotated to its most adverse orientation (i.e., major axis of template oriented parallel to the major axis of the opening.)
Step 5:
Place the large head template in the opening, again with the plane of the template parallel to the plane of the opening, and try to insert it through the opening.
Pass: The large head template can be freely insert- ed through the opening
Fail: The opening admits the small torso template but does not admit the large head template.
No: Pass. Stop
Yes: Continue
 52

B.2.5. Completely bounded openings with limited depth of penetration
The configuration of some openings may be such that the depth of penetration is a critical issue for determining the entrapment potential. For example, consider a vertical wall or some other barrier behind a step ladder. The entrapment potential depends not only on the dimensions of the opening between adjacent steps but also on the horizontal space between the lower boundary of the opening and the barrier. A child may enter the opening between adjacent steps feet first and may proceed to pass through the space between the rear of the lower step and the barrier and become entrapped when the child’s head is unable to pass through either of these two openings. In effect, there are openings in two dif- ferent planes, and each has the potential for head entrap- ment and should be tested.
Figure B16 illustrates these two planes for a step ladder as well as for a generic opening. Plane A is the plane of the completely bounded opening in question, and Plane B is the plane of the opening encompassing the horizontal space between the lower boundary of the opening in Plane A and the barrier that should also be tested for entrapment hazards.
Step 2: Step 3:
Step 4:
Step 5:
Step 6:
Step 7:
Identify all completely bounded openings with lim- ited depth of penetration.
Place the small torso template in the opening in Plane A with its plane parallel to Plane A; rotate the template to its most adverse orientation with respect to the opening while keeping it parallel to Plane A.
Determine if the opening in Plane A admits the small torso template in any orientation when rotat- ed about its own axis.
No: Pass. The opening is small enough to prevent either head first or feet first entry by the smallest user at risk and is not an entrapment hazard.
Yes: Continue.
Place the small torso template in the opening in Plane B with its plane parallel to Plane B; rotate the template to its most adverse orientation with respect to the opening while keeping it parallel to Plane B.
Determine if the opening in Plane B admits the small torso template.
No: Pass. The depth of penetration into the open- ing in Plane A is insufficient to result in entrapment of the smallest user at risk.
Yes: Continue.
Place the large head template (Figure B5) in the opening in Plane A with its plane parallel to Plane A. Determine if the opening in Plane A admits the large head template.
No: Fail. A child, whose torso can enter the open- ing in Plane A as well as the opening in Plane B, may become entrapped by the head in the opening in Plane A.
Yes: Continue.
With the plane of the large head template parallel to the opening in Plane B, determine if the opening in Plane B admits the large head template.
No: Fail. The largest user at risk cannot exit the opening in Plane B.
Yes: Pass. The openings in Plane A and Plane B do not pose an entrapment risk.
B.2.5.4.1 Test procedure
Step 1:
Select the appropriate small torso template based on the intended users of the playground (Figure B3 for toddler playgrounds, Figure B4 for preschool-age and school-age playgrounds).

 B.2.5.5 Flexible openings
Climbing components such as flexible nets are also a special case for the entrapment tests because the size and shape of openings on this equipment can be altered when force is applied, either intentionally or simply when a child climbs on or falls through the openings. Children are then potentially at risk of entrapment in these distorted openings.
The procedure for determining conformance to the entrap- ment recommendations for flexible openings requires two three-dimensional test probes which are illustrated in Figure B6, Figure B7, and Figure B8 are applied to an opening in a flexible component with a force of up to 50 pounds.
B.2.5.5.1 Test procedure
Step 6:
Step 7:
Place the large head probe (Figure B8) in the open- ing with the plane of its base parallel to the plane of the opening.
Determine if the large head probe can be pushed or pulled completely through the opening by a force no greater than 30 pounds on toddler playgrounds or 50 pounds on preschool-age and school-age play- grounds.
Yes: Pass. Stop.
No: Fail. FAIL

Identify all completely bounded openings with flexi- ble sides.
Place the small torso probes (Figures B6 and B7) in the opening, tapered end first, with the plane of its base parallel to the plane of the opening.
Rotate the probe to its most adverse orientation (major axis of probe parallel to major axis of open- ing) while keeping the base parallel to the plane of the opening.
Determine if the probe can be pushed or pulled completely through the opening by a force no greater than 30 pounds on toddler playgrounds or 50 pounds on preschool-age and school-age play- grounds.

 B.2.5. Partially bound openings
A partially bound opening is any opening which has at least one side or portion open, such as a U- or V-shaped opening. These openings can still pose an entrapment hazard by allowing the neck to enter but not allowing the head to slip out. A partially bound opening can be any part of the play- ground equipment where a child could get his or her neck caught, so it includes not only two- or three-sided openings, but also areas of large openings (large enough for the head template to enter) that have the characteristics that can entrap a child’s neck. Several examples outlines of this situa- tion are shown in the figures below. Openings that have an outline similar to these figures are often found when two parts of a playground meet, for example, the top of a slide and the side of a guardrail.
Identifying partially bound openings varies depending on the age range of the playground. Openings that should be tested include any opening where:
For toddlers:
• The perimeter of the opening is not closed
• The lowest leg of the opening is tilted upward (i.e. above horizontal) or 45 degrees below horizontal.
For preschool- and school-age:
• The perimeter of the opening is not closed
• The lowest leg of the opening is tilted upward (i.e. above horizontal)
                Examples of partially bound openings. Note, these examples are intended to illustrate the principle of partially bound openings and may or may not require testing.

APPENDIX E
DISHWASHING PROCEDURE
The best way to wash, rinse, and disinfect dishes and eating utensils is to use a dishwasher with a sanitizing cycle. The final sanitizing rinse of a dishwasher must reach a temperature of 180 degrees. If a dishwasher is not available or cannot be installed, a three-compartment sink will be needed to wash, rinse, and disinfect dishes. A two-compartment or one-compartment sink can be used in child care facilities (located in an occupied residence) licensed for 12 or fewer children by adding one or two dishpans, as needed. In addition to three compartments or dishpans, you will need a dish rack with a drain board to allow dishes and utensils to air dry. To wash, rinse, and disinfect dishes by hand:
o Fill one sink compartment or dishpan with hot tap water and a dishwashing detergent.
o Fill the second compartment or dishpan with hot tap water.
o Fill the third compartment or dishpan with hot tap water and 1-1/2 tablespoons of
liquid chlorine bleach for each gallon of water.
o Scrape dishes and utensils and dispose of excess food.
o Immerse scraped dish or utensil in first sink compartment or dishpan and wash thoroughly.
o Rinse dish or utensil in second dishpan of clear water.
o Immerse dish or utensil in third dishpan of chlorinated water for at least 1 minute. o Place dish or utensil in a rack to air dry.
Note: Food preparation and dishwashing sinks should only be used for these activities and should never be used for routine hand washing or diaper changing activities.

HAND WASHING PROCEDURE
!Always use warm, running water and a mild, preferably liquid, soap. Antibacterial soaps may be used, but are not required. Pre-moistened cleansing toweletts do not effectively clean hands and do not take the place of hand washing.
!Wet the hands and apply a small amount (dime to quarter size) of liquid soap to hands.
!Rub hands together vigorously until a soapy lather appears and continue for at least 15 seconds.
Be sure to scrub between fingers, under fingernails, and around the tips and palms of the hands. !Rinse hands under warm running water. Leave the water running while drying hands.
!Dry hands with a clean, disposable (or single use) towel, being careful to avoid touch the faucet handles or towel holder with clean hands.
!Turn the faucet off using the towel as a barrier between your hands and the faucet handle. !Discard the used towel in a trash can lined with a fluid-resistant (plastic) bag. Trash cans with
foot-petal operated lids are preferable.
!Consider using hand lotion to prevent chapping of hands. If using lotions, use liquids or tubes that can be squirted so that the hands do not have direct contact with container spout. Direct contact with the spout could contaminate the lotion inside the container.
!When assisting a child in hand washing, either hold the child (if an infant) or have the child stand on a safety step at a height at which the child’s hands can hang freely under the running water. Assist the child in performing all of the above steps and then wash your own hands.

CLEANING AND DISINFECTION PROCEDURES

APPENDIX H
CLEANING AND DISINFECTION PROCEDURES
Keeping the child care environment clean and orderly is very important for health, safety, and the emotional well-being of both children and providers. One of the most important steps in reducing the number of germs, and therefore the spread of disease, is the thorough cleaning of surfaces that could possibly pose a risk to children or staff. Surfaces considered most likely to be contaminated are those with which children are most likely to have close contact. These include toys that children put in their mouths, crib rails, food preparation areas, and surfaces likely to become very contaminated with germs, such as diaper-changing areas.
Routine cleaning with soap and water is the most useful method for removing germs from surfaces in the child care setting. Good mechanical cleaning (scrubbing with soap and water) physically reduces the numbers of germs from the surface, just as hand washing reduces the numbers of germs from the hands. Removing germs in the child care setting is especially important for soiled surfaces which cannot be treated with chemical disinfectants, such as some upholstery fabrics.
However, some items and surfaces should receive an additional step, disinfection, to kill germs after cleaning with soap and rinsing with clear water. Items that can be washed in a dishwasher or hot cycle of a washing machine do not have to be disinfected because these machines use water that is hot enough for a long enough period of time to kill most germs. The disinfection process uses chemicals that are stronger than soap and water. Disinfection also usually requires soaking or drenching the item for several minutes to give the chemical time to kill the remaining germs. Commercial products that meet the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA’s standards for “hospital grade” germicides (solutions that kill germs) may be used for this purpose. One of the most commonly used chemicals for disinfection in child care settings is a homemade solution of household bleach and water. Bleach is cheap and easy to get. The solution of bleach and water is easy to mix, is nontoxic, is safe if handled properly, and kill most infectious agents. (Be aware that some infectious agents are not killed by bleach. For example, cryptosporidia is only killed ammonia or hydrogen peroxide.)
A solution of bleach and water loses its strength very quickly and easily. It is weakened by organic material, evaporation, heat, and sunlight. Therefore, bleach solutions should be mixed fresh each day to make sure it is effective. Any leftover solution should be discarded and the end of the day. NEVER mix bleach with anything but fresh tap water! Other chemicals may react with bleach and create and release a toxic chlorine gas.
Keep the bleach solution you mix each day in a cool place out of direct sunlight and out of the reach of children. (Although a solution of bleach and water mixed as shown in the accompanying box should not be harmful if accidentally swallowed, you should keep all chemicals away from children.)

If a child care facility uses a commercial cleaner, sanitizer, or disinfectant it must be a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-registered product that has an EPA registration number on the label. Such products shall only be used according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
NOTE: All EPA-registered products may not be appropriate for use in a child care facility. Therefore, it is the responsibility of the facility to make sure any product use is appropriate for use in a child care facility.
Recipe for Bleach Disinfecting Solution
(For use on non-porous surfaces such as diaper change tables, counter tops, door and cabinet handles toilets, etc.)
1⁄4 - 3⁄4 cup bleach
1 gallon of cool water
OR
1 - 3 tablespoon bleach 1 quart of cool water
Apply as a spray or poured fresh solution, not by dipping into a container with a cloth that has been in contact with a contaminated surface.
Add the household bleach (5.25% sodium hypochlorite) to the water.
Recipe for Weaker Bleach Sanitizing Solution
For food contact surfaces sanitizing, e.g., dishes, utensils, cutting boards, highchair trays, and toys, that children may place in their mouths, and pacifiers.
Washing and Disinfecting Toys
1 tablespoon bleach 1 gallon cool water
Add the bleach to the water
! Infants and toddlers should not share toys. Toys that children (particularly infants and toddlers) put in their mouths should be washed and disinfected between uses by individual children. Toys for infants and toddlers should be chosen with this in mind. If you cannot wash a toy, it probably is not appropriate for an infant or toddler.
! When an infant or toddler finishes playing with a toy, you should retrieve it form the play area and put it in a bin reserved for dirty toys. This bin should be out of reach of the

children. Toys can be washed at a later, more convenient time, and then transferred to a bin for clean toys and safely reused by the other children.
! To wash and disinfect a hard plastic toy:
Scrub the toy in warm, soapy water. Use a brush to reach into the crevices. Rinse the toy in clean water.
Immerse the toy in a mild bleach solution (see above) and allow it to soak in the solution for 10-20 minutes.
Remove the toy from the bleach and rinse well in cool water.
Air dry.
! Hard plastic toys that are washed in a dishwasher or cloth toys washed in the hot water cycle of the hot water cycle of a washing machine do not need to be additionally disinfected.
! Children in diapers should only have washable toys. Each group of children should have its own toys. Toys should not be shared with other groups.
! Stuffed toys used by only a single child should be cleaned in a washing machine every week or more frequently if heavily soiled.
! Toys and equipment used by older children and not put into their mouths should be cleaned at least weekly and when obviously soiled. A soap and water wash followed by clear water rinsing and air drying should be adequate. No disinfection is required. (These types of toys and equipment include blocks, dolls, tricycles, trucks, and other similar toys.).
! Do not use wading pools for children in diapers.
! Water play tables can spread germs. To prevent this:
Disinfect the table with chlorine bleach solution before filling it with water.
Disinfect the all toys to be used in the table with chlorine bleach solution. Avoid using sponge toys. They can trap bacteria and are difficult to clean.
Have all children wash their hands before and after playing in the water table. Do not allow children with open sores or wounds to play in the water table. Carefully supervise the children to make sure they do not drink the water. Discard water after play is over
Washing and Disinfecting Bathroom and Other Surfaces
Bathroom surfaces, such as faucet handles and toilet seats, should be washed and disinfected several times a day, if possible, but at least once a day or when soiled. The bleach and water solution or chlorine-containing scouring powers or other commercial bathroom surface cleaner/disinfectants can be used in these areas. Surfaces that infants and young toddlers are likely to touch or mouth, such as crib rails, should be washed with soap and water and disinfected with a nontoxic disinfectant, such as bleach solution, at least once every day, more often if visibly soiled. After the surface has been drenched or soaked with the disinfectant for at least 10 minutes, surfaces likely to be mouthed should be thoroughly wiped with a fresh towel

moistened with tap water. Be sure not to use a toxic cleaner on surfaces likely to be mouthed. Floors should be washed and disinfected at least once a day and whenever soiled.
Washing and Disinfecting Diaper Changing Areas
Diaper Changing Areas should:
Only be used for changing diapers.
Be smooth and nonporous, such as Formica (NOT wood).
Have a raised edge or low fence around the area to prevent a child from falling off. Be next to a sink with hot and cold running water.
Not be used to prepare food, mix formula, or rinse pacifiers.
Be easily accessible to providers.
Be out of reach of children.
Diaper changing areas should be cleaned and disinfected after each diaper changer as follows: Clean the surface with soap and water and rinse with clear water.
Dry the surface with a paper towel.
Thoroughly wet the surface with the recommended bleach solution.
Wipe dry with a clean disposable towel or air dry. If using a commercial disinfectant/sanitizer, follow labeled manufacturer’s instructions.
Washing and Disinfecting Clothing, Linen, and Furnishings
Do not wash or rinse clothing soiled with fecal material in the child care setting. You may empty solid stool into the toilet, but be careful not to splash or touch toilet water with your hands. Put the soiled clothes in a plastic bag and seal the bag to await pick up by the child’s parent or guardian at the end of the day. Always wash your hands after handling soiled clothing.
Explain to parents that washing or rinsing soiled diapers and clothing increases the chances that you and the children may be exposed to germs that cause diseases. Although receiving soiled clothes is not pleasant, remind parents that this policy protects the health of all children and providers. Each item of sleep equipment, including cribs, cots, mattresses, blankets, sheets, etc., should be cleaned and sanitized before being assigned to a specific child. The bedding items should be labeled with that child’s name, and should only be used by that child. Children shall not share bedding. Infants linens (sheets, pillowcases, blankets) shall be cleaned and sanitized daily, and crib mattresses shall be cleaned and sanitized weekly and when soiled or wet. Linens from beds of older children shall be laundered at least weekly and whenever soiled. However, if a child inadvertently used another child’s bedding, you shall change the linen and mattress cover before allowing the assigned child to use it again. All blankets shall be changed and laundered routinely at least once a week.
Cleaning up Body Fluid Spills
Spills of body fluids, including blood, feces, nasal and eyed discharges, saliva, urine, and vomit shall be cleaned up immediately. Wear gloves unless the fluid can be easily contained by the material (e.g., paper tissue or cloth) that is being used to clean it up. Be careful not to get any of

the fluid you are cleaning in your eyes, nose, mouth or any open sores you may have. Clean and disinfect any surfaces, such as counter tops and floors, on which body fluids have been spilled. Discard fluid-contaminated material in a plastic bag that has been securely sealed. Mops used to clean up body fluids should be (1) cleaned, (2) rinsed with a disinfecting solution, (3) wrung as dry as possible, and (4) hung to dry completely. Be sure to wash your hands after cleaning up any spill.

INTRODUCTION
COMMUNICABLE DISEASES/CONDITIONS AND RETURN TO CHILD CARE
Childcare providers frequently must make decisions regarding when children with communicable diseases/conditions should be allowed to attend or return to the out-of-home child care setting (a large child care center or where child care is provided in a private residence for more than one child). We hope the information provided in this booklet will help with these decisions. It contains information about the most common or important communicable diseases/conditions and how they are spread. Information is listed about the different times during which infectious agents may be transmitted from one person to another, and when it is usually safe for someone who has one of these conditions to return to the center. The “return to child care times” are based on the usual period of time that a person is considered to be contagious — not on the period of time that may be necessary for full clinical recovery from the signs or symptoms of an illness which may vary a great deal from person to person.
While this booklet will serve as a guide for child care attendance of children with communicable conditions, the Mississippi State Department of Health (MSDH) welcomes the opportunity to help with your decisions. You may contact your district health department office (see district map on page 18) or the Division of Epidemiology at the MSDH in Jackson to speak with a consultant.

GENERAL INFORMATION
Small children who are cared for in out-of-home group settings are at a greater risk of acquiring and spreading a contagious disease. Small children are highly susceptible to contagious diseases since most of them have not been exposed to many of the most common germs and therefore do not have any immunity to them. Young children also have certain habits (e.g., putting their fingers and other objects in their mouths) that can easily spread germs. Even though contagious diseases/conditions will occur in a child care setting, the child care provider must do everything he or she can to prevent and control the spread of disease. The use of common sense hygienic practices, especially frequent and thorough hand washing cannot be stressed enough! Also, making sure that staff and children are up to date on their immunizations helps to lessen the risk of exposure to contagious diseases.
Reportable diseases: There are 4 classes of reportable diseases. Class I diseases are those of major public health importance and are to be reported upon first knowledge or suspicion and are usually reported by the physician, hospital or laboratory. However, the MSDH encourages child care providers who know of a child in their facility who has been diagnosed with a disease such as meningitis or measles to report it to the Health Department. This can sometimes help to expedite the investigation. Class II diseases may require public health intervention also, especially if there are several cases in one room (e.g., diarrheal diseases such as shigella and giardia).
When a Class I reportable disease is reported to the MSDH, there will be an investigation. The immediacy of the response by the MSDH and the extent of the investigation depend on the disease the person has. For example, if a child has been reported to have meningococcal meningitis, an investigation would take place as soon as the report is received. It is the goal of the MSDH to provide preventive medication to those for whom it would be indicated within 24 hours of receiving the report. A current list of the reportable diseases is provided in Appendix B of the Child Care Rules and Regulations.
Outbreaks/parental permission for laboratory tests: During times when there are outbreaks of Giardia, Shigella infection, etc., large numbers of stool specimens may be requested by the MSDH. The MSDH recommends that child care facilities obtain permission from parents or guardians at the time of enrollment for the child care facility to collect these stool specimens and receive the laboratory results if and when such an outbreak occurs. These laboratory tests would be done by the MSDH Laboratory free of charge. The laboratory test results would be sent to the child care facility and given to the parents/guardians by the child care facility for them to give to the child’s physician. (See sample permission slip on page 17)
Handouts: It is good practice to keep parents informed as to what diseases might be occurring in the child care facility so that they can be alert to signs and symptoms of diseases and observe their children for them. We have provided a packet with fact sheets/handouts on certain diseases for you to give to parents.

ATTENDEES
CHILD CARE IMMUNIZATION REQUIREMENTS (FOR ATTENDEES AND STAFF)
The MSDH regulations governing the licensure of child care facilities mandate that each child in a licensed facility have immunizations according to the recommended immunization schedule. These children are to be age-appropriately immunized and must have a Certificate of Immunization Compliance (Form 121) or a Certificate of Medical Exemption (Form 122) on file at the child care facility and readily accessible for review by the MSDH. The Form 121 must be signed by the District Health Officer, a physician, nurse, or designee. The medical exemption, Form 122, MUST be signed by the District Health Officer. Children enrolled in licensed child care facilities and public and private schools in Mississippi may be exempt for medical reasons only and not for religious reasons.
Children usually begin their routine immunizations between 6 weeks and 2 months of age. The immunizations that are currently required at the age-appropriate times for child care are: DTaP (diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis), polio, MMR (measles, mumps, rubella), and HIB (H. Influenzae type b). Hepatitis B vaccine is a recommended vaccine, and is usually started at birth to 2 months of age. Hepatitis B is not required for child care attendance but is required for entry into 5 year old kindergarten.
As of August 01, 2002, one (1) dose of Varicella (chicken pox) vaccine is required on or after the 1st birthday and is required for entry into five (5) year-old kindergarten. Varicella is not required if a history of the disease is documented.
Children enrolled in a licensed child care facility or Head Start Center are expected to be age appropriately immunized. All children must have one of the following forms before enrollment in a licensed Child Care/Head Start facility.
1. Certificate of Immunization Compliance (Form 121). This form must be signed by the District Health Officer, a physician, nurse, or designee.
2. Certificate of Medical Exemption (Form 122). This form must be approved and signed by the Mississippi Department of Health District Health Officer from the public health district or the State Epidemiologist.
STAFF
Anyone (whether full or part-time and even if they are the owner/director) who works in a licensed child care facility must have a Certificate of Immunization Compliance (Form 121) or a Certificate of Medical Exemption from Immunization Requirements for Adults (Form 132) on file and readily accessible for review by the MSDH. The requirement for adults is that they must show proof of immunity to measles (rubeola or “red” measles) and rubella (“German” or “3-day” measles).

Proof of immunity to measles: Persons born prior to 01-01-1957 are assumed to have natural immunity to measles. Persons born on or after 01-01-1957 must show proof of immunity in one of the following ways:
1. A physician’s statement saying that the person has had measles disease.
2. Serological (a blood test) confirmation of measles immunity.
3. A record of 2 doses of measles-containing vaccine (usually given as MMR) given on or after
the first birthday and on or after 01-01-1968. There must be a minimum time interval of 30 days between the 2 doses.
Proof of immunity to rubella: All child care workers, regardless of age, must show proof of immunity to rubella in one of the following ways:
1. Serological (blood test) confirmation of rubella immunity.
2. A rubella vaccination received on or after 12 months of age and on or after 01-01-1969.
The MSDH does not provide serological testing for measles and rubella for the purpose of child care/school attendance or private employment. Those who wish to have a blood test for proof of immunity to measles and/or rubella should see their private physician.
The Child Care Licensure Division of the MSDH checks the immunization records in child care facilities during regular program reviews. District Immunization Representatives also visit child care centers on a random basis to inspect the immunization records of the children and the employees. The purpose of these visits is to verify the presence of the Certificates of Immunization Compliance. These visits also help to ensure adequate immunization of children enrolled in child care facilities.
EXCLUSION CRITERIA
Small children can become ill very quickly. The child care provider should observe each child’s health throughout the time the child is in their care. If the child care provider observes signs and symptoms of illness that would require removal from the facility, he/she should contact the parents/guardians to have the child picked up and continue to observe the child for other signs and symptoms. If the child is not responding to you, is having trouble breathing, or is having a seizure or convulsion, call 911.
The following conditions require exclusion from child care:
Fever:
Diarrhea:
Vomiting:
Defined as 100°F or higher taken under the arm, 101°F taken orally, or 102°F taken rectally. For children 4 months or younger, the lower rectal temperature of 101°F is considered a fever threshold.
Frequent (3 or more episodes in a 24-hour period) runny, watery, or bloody stools. According to CDC recommendations, a child who is not toilet trained and has diarrhea should be excluded from child care settings regardless of the cause.

Sore throat with fever and swollen glands
The child gets red or blue in the face or makes high-pitched whooping sound after coughing.
Thick mucus or pus draining from the eye Yellow eyes and skin

CHICKENPOX (VARICELLA)
Chickenpox is a highly infectious viral disease that begins with small red bumps that turn into blisters after several hours. The blisters generally last for 3-4 days and then begin to dry up and form scabs. These lesions (bumps/blisters) almost always appear first on the trunk rather than the extremities.
Mode of transmission: Airborne droplets of nose and throat secretions coughed into the air by someone who has chickenpox. Also by direct contact with articles freshly soiled with discharge from the blisters and/or discharge from the nose and mouth (e.g., tissues, handkerchiefs, etc.).
Notification: Notify parents/guardians and staff members that a case of chickenpox has occurred, especially those parents whose child is taking steroid medications, being treated with cancer or leukemia drugs or has a weakened immune system for some reason. Staff members who are pregnant and have never had chickenpox disease or the chickenpox vaccine should consult their physician immediately. A special preventive treatment may be indicated for those with a weakened immune system and non-immune pregnant women. This treatment must be given within 96 hours of the exposure to be effective.
Vaccine: As of August 01, 2002, one (1) dose of Varicella (chicken pox) vaccine is required on or after the 1st birthday and is required for entry into five (5) year-old kindergarten. Varicella is not required if a history of the disease is documented.
Return to child care: Once the diagnosis has been made, determine the day that the blisters first appeared. The child may return to child care on the 6th day after the blisters first appeared or earlier if all the lesions are crusted and dry and no new ones are forming. Keeping the child home until all the lesions are completely healed is unnecessary and results in excessive absences.

SHINGLES (VARICELLA ZOSTER)
Shingles (varicella zoster) is a reactivation of the chickenpox virus (varicella). After the initial infection with chickenpox, the virus continues to lie dormant (inactive) in a nerve root. We tend to think of the elderly and immunosuppressed individuals as the ones who have shingles; however, it can and does occur sometimes in children. The lesions or blisters of shingles resemble those of chickenpox and usually appear in just one area or on one side (unilateral) of the body and run along a nerve pathway. A mild shingles-like illness has been reported in healthy children who have had the chickenpox vaccine. This is a rare occurrence.
Mode of transmission: It is possible for someone who has never had chickenpox disease or the vaccine to get chickenpox by coming in contact with the fluid from the lesions of someone who has shingles. Shingles itself is not transmissible. A person who has shingles does not transmit chickenpox through the air as does someone who has chickenpox disease.
Return to child care: The child who has shingles may attend child care if the lesions can be covered by clothing. If the lesions cannot be covered, the child should be excluded until the lesions are crusted and dry. Staff members who have shingles pose little risk to others since the lesions would be covered by clothing or a dressing on exposed areas. Thorough hand washing is warranted whenever there is contact with the lesions.
NOTE: Staff members, especially those who are pregnant, who have no history of chickenpox disease or chickenpox vaccine, should not take care of children with shingles during the time they have active or fluid-filled lesions.
CYTOMEGALOVIRUS (CMV)
CMV is a viral illness that most people become infected with during childhood. Small children usually have no symptoms when they become infected, but older children may develop an illness similar to mononucleosis with a fever, sore throat, malaise or feeling very tired and an enlarged liver.
Mode of transmission: CMV is spread from person to person by direct contact with body fluids such as urine, saliva, or blood. The virus can also be passed from the mother to the baby before birth.
Pregnancy: Rarely, a woman may contract the disease for the first time during pregnancy which may pose a risk to the fetus causing certain birth defects. CDC recommends that women who are child care providers and who expect to become pregnant should be tested for antibodies to CMV and if the test shows no evidence of previous CMV infection, they should reduce their contact with infected children by working, at least temporarily, with children 2 years of age and older where there is less circulation of the virus. Also, they should avoid kissing an infected child on the lips, and as with any child care situation, wash hands thoroughly after each diaper change and contact with a child’s saliva. If contact with children does not involve exposure to saliva or urine, there should be no fear of potential infection with CMV.

Amended July 12, 2017, Effective August 16, 2017
Office of Health Protection Child Care Facilities Licensure Division

Return to child care: There is no need to exclude children with CMV from child care as long as they do not have a fever since the virus may be excreted in urine and saliva for many months and may persist or there may be recurring episodes for several years following the initial infection. CMV is a virus that may persist as a latent infection and recur when a person becomes immunosuppressed with conditions such as cancer, AIDS, etc.
DIARRHEAL DISEASES (e.g., campylobacteriosis, cryptosporidiosis, giardiasis, rotavirus, salmonellosis, shigellosis) - See E. coli O157:H7 and Hepatitis A sections for specific return-to- child- care recommendations regarding these 2 diseases.
Diarrhea is defined as frequent (3 or more episodes within a 24 hour period), runny, watery stools and can be caused by different types of organisms such as viruses, bacteria and parasites.
Mode of transmission: Diarrheal diseases are generally transmitted or spread by ingesting food or water or by putting something in the mouth such as a toy that has been contaminated with the feces (stool/poop) of an infected person or animal. In some cases such as with Salmonella and E. coli O157:H7, the disease is transmitted by eating raw or undercooked meats (especially ground beef and poultry) and unpasteurized milk and fruit juices.
Notification: Notify parents/guardians of children in the involved room of the illness. Ask that they have any child with diarrhea, severe cramping, or vomiting evaluated by a physician and that they inform the day care of diarrheal illness in their child and family.
Outbreak situation: Most diarrheal diseases are reportable to the State Department of Health. When there are 2 or more cases of a diarrheal disease in one room, more extensive notification may need to be done as stool specimens may need to be collected. In this case, the director of the child care should consult with the Public Health District Epidemiology Nurse or the Division of Epidemiology at the State Department of Health. (See Public Health District Map on page 18 for addresses and telephone numbers)
Return to child care: In most cases, a child may return to child care after a diarrheal illness once he or she is free of fever and the diarrhea has ceased.
E. COLI O157:H7
Escherichia (E.) coli bacteria are found in the intestines of most humans and many animals. These infections are usually harmless. However, certain strains of the bacteria such as the O157:H7 can cause severe illness. Some persons who are infected with E. coli O157:H7 may have a mild disease while others develop a severe, bloody diarrhea. In some cases, the infection may cause a breakdown of the red blood cells which can lead to HUS or hemolytic uremic syndrome.
Mode of transmission: E. coli O157:H7 is usually the result of eating undercooked meat, especially hamburger. There have also been cases reported from drinking unpasteurized apple

juice. Person-to-person transmission may occur by contact with the feces or stool of an infected person.
Notification: Notify the staff and parents/guardians that a case of E. coli O157:H7 has occurred and ask that they have their child evaluated by a physician if they have diarrhea, especially bloody diarrhea. E. coli O157:H7 is a Class I reportable disease and a follow-up investigation will be done by the Health Department.
Return to child care: The infected child should not be in or allowed to return to a child care center until his/her diarrhea has ceased and 2 consecutive negative stool samples are obtained (collected not less than 24 hours apart and not sooner than 48 hours after the last dose of antibiotics).
FIFTH DISEASE (ERYTHEMA INFECTIOSUM)
This is an infectious disease characterized by a “slapped -face” (redness) appearance of the cheeks followed by a rash on the trunk and extremities.
Mode of transmission: Person-to-person spread by direct contact with nose and throat secretions of an infected person. Transmission of infection can be lessened by routine hygienic practices which include hand washing and the proper disposal of facial tissues containing respiratory secretions.
Notification: Notify parents/guardians and staff members that fifth disease is occurring in the child care facility. Staff members who are pregnant should consult their obstetrician if children in their room have fifth disease.
Return to child care: Children with fifth disease may attend child care if they are free of fever, since by the time the rash begins they are no longer contagious. The rash may come and go for several weeks.
“FLU” (INFLUENZA)
Influenza is an acute (sudden onset) viral disease of the respiratory tract characterized by fever, headache, muscle aches, joint pain, malaise, nasal congestion, sore throat, and cough. Influenza in children may be indistinguishable from diseases caused by other respiratory viruses.
Mode of transmission: Direct contact with nose and throat secretions of someone who has influenza - airborne spread by these secretions coughed into the air.
Return to child care: The child may return to child care when free of fever and feeling well. The closing of individual schools and child care centers has not proven to be an effective control measure. By the time absenteeism is high enough to warrant closing, it is too late to prevent spread.

HAND-FOOT- AND- MOUTH DISEASE
This is a common childhood disease caused by a strain of coxsackievirus. In some people, the virus causes mild to no symptoms. In others, it may result in painful blisters in the mouth and on the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet.
Mode of transmission: The virus can be spread through saliva from the blisters in the mouth and from the fluid from the blisters on the hands and feet. It is also spread through the feces or stool of an infected person.
Notification: Notify parents/guardians and staff that there are cases of hand-foot-and-mouth disease in the child care facility so that they can be alert to the signs and symptoms.
Return to child care: The virus may be excreted in the stool for weeks after the symptoms have disappeared. Children who have blisters in their mouths and drool or who have weeping or active lesions/blisters on their hands should be excluded from child care until the lesions are crusted and dry and the child is free of fever.
HEAD LICE
This is an infestation of the scalp by small “bugs” called lice. They firmly attach egg sacs called “nits” to the hairs, and these nits are difficult to remove. Treatment may be accomplished with prescription or over-the-counter medicines applied to the scalp.
Mode of transmission: Direct contact with an infested person’s hair (head-to-head) and, to a lesser extent, direct contact with their personal belongings, especially shared clothing and headgear. Head lice do not jump or fly from one person to another, but they can crawl very quickly when heads are touching.
Notification: When a case of head lice occurs in a room, notify the parents/guardians that a case of head lice has occurred. Check the other children in that room for head lice and if found, notify their parents/.guardians that the child needs treatment. Ask the parents/guardians to be alert to anyone in their family who may have signs and symptoms of head lice (e.g., excessive itching of the scalp, especially at the nape of the neck and around the ears) so that they may also receive treatment.
Infants and children less than 2 yrs. of age: It is a rare occurrence for children in this age group to have head lice. It is generally not recommended to treat this age group prophylactically or just because someone else in the family has been treated. If a child of this age is found to have head lice, the parent/guardian should consult the child’s physician for treatment recommendations.
Return to child care: The child may return to child care after the first treatment has been given. (See Attachment A - “Recommendations for the Control of Head Lice in the Child Care Setting”)

HEPATITIS A
This is an infectious viral disease characterized by jaundice (yellowing of the eyes and skin), loss of appetite, nausea, and general weakness. Child care centers can be a major source of hepatitis A spread in the community. This is because small children usually do not show any specific signs and symptoms of the disease. Symptomatic illness primarily occurs among adult contacts of infected, asymptomatic children.
Mode of transmission: Hepatitis A virus is found in the stool of persons infected with hepatitis A. The virus is usually spread from person to person by putting something in the mouth that has been contaminated with the stool of an infected person; for this reason, the virus is more easily spread under poor sanitary conditions, and when good personal hygiene, especially good hand washing, is not observed. Rarely, the virus is contracted by eating raw seafood (e.g., raw oysters) that has been collected from contaminated waters.
Notification: Notify the staff and parents/guardians that a case has occurred. Hepatitis A is a Class I reportable disease. A follow-up investigation will be done by the MSDH to determine who in the center may need to receive preventive treatment.
Return to child care: The child may return to child care one week after the onset of jaundice (yellowing of the eyes and skin) or one week after the onset of other signs and symptoms if no jaundice is present.
HEPATITIS B
Hepatitis B is a viral disease that affects the liver. It is a contagious condition characterized by loss of appetite, abdominal discomfort, jaundice (yellowing of the eyes and skin), joint aches, and fever in some cases. It is different from Hepatitis A. There should not be any risk of exposure to hepatitis B in a normal child care setting unless a child who is infected with hepatitis B is bleeding. Also, since the hepatitis B vaccine is now a part of the routine immunization schedule, more and more children should be immune.
Mode of transmission: The most common mode of transmission is through having sex with someone who has the virus; however, it can be transmitted when infected blood enters the body through cuts, scrapes or other breaks in the skin. Injecting drug users are at risk when they share needles with an infected person. It is also possible for infected pregnant women to transmit the virus to their babies during pregnancy or at delivery.
If an exposure to a person who is infected with hepatitis B has occurred, the person exposed should be referred to his/her physician since hepatitis B vaccine and hepatitis B immune globulin may be indicated. Since hepatitis B and HIV/AIDS are both transmitted through blood exposure, the precautionary measures for HIV/AIDS would also apply to hepatitis B. (See HIV/AIDS section below)

HEPATITIS C
Hepatitis C is also a viral disease that affects the liver. Again, hepatitis C should pose no risk of exposure in the normal child care setting unless the infected child is bleeding. There is no vaccine available for hepatitis C at this time. Since it is also transmitted through blood exposure, the same precautionary measures for hepatitis B and HIV/AIDS would be apply to hepatitis C. (See HIV/AIDS section below)
HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS (HIV) INFECTION/ ACQUIRED IMMUNODEFICIENCY SYNDROME (AIDS)
Mode of transmission: The most common mode of transmission is through having sex with someone who has the virus; however, it can be transmitted when infected blood enters the body through cuts, scrapes or other breaks in the skin. Injecting drug users are at risk when they share needles with an infected person. It is also possible for infected pregnant women to transmit the virus to their babies during pregnancy or at delivery. Although HIV and hepatitis B are transmitted in the same way, HIV is much more difficult to transmit from one person to another than hepatitis B.
HIV infection in children causes a broad spectrum of disease manifestations and a varied clinical course. Children with HIV infection should be monitored closely by their physician. They are more susceptible to infectious diseases than other children. Parents of children known to have HIV infection should be notified when certain infectious diseases occur in the child care facility. There is no vaccine available for HIV at this time. According to CDC, HIV is not likely to be spread from one child to another in the child care setting and no case has ever been reported. Parents or guardians of HIV-positive children should inform the child care director of their child’s HIV status. Because of concern over stigmatization, the person aware of a child’s HIV infection should be limited to those who need such knowledge to care for the children in the child care setting. In a situation where there is concern of possible exposure of others to the blood or body fluids of an infected person, CDC recommends that a team including the child’s parents or guardians, the child’s physician, public health personnel, and the proposed child care provider evaluate the situation to determine the most appropriate child care setting. The team should weigh the risks and benefits to both the infected child and to others in the child care setting.
It should always be remembered that there those who are known to be infected with HIV, hepatitis B and C and other blood borne diseases, but on the other hand there are those we do not know about and some people are not even aware themselves that they may have an infectious blood borne disease. Therefore, we must always employ universal precautions (treating everyone’s blood as though it is infectious) when dealing with blood and body fluids. There is no evidence that HIV, hepatitis B or hepatitis C is transmitted through tears, perspiration, urine, or saliva unless these body fluids contain visible blood.
Child care providers should be prepared to handle blood and blood-containing body fluids using the principles of universal precautions. Supplies of gloves, disposable towels, and disinfectants should be readily available.

The Mississippi State Department of Health is available for consultation in these situations.
IMPETIGO
This is a contagious skin disease characterized by spreading pustular lesions (sores with pus) and should receive medical treatment. This is quite important to avoid the risk of complications involving the heart and kidneys.
Mode of transmission: Skin-to-skin contact with the sores.
Return to child care: The child may return to child care 24 hours after treatment has been started if
free of fever and the lesions are not draining.
MEASLES
Measles is a serious viral infection characterized by a rash (red, flat lesions) starting on the head and neck, which enlarge and coalesce (run together), and spread to the trunk, then to the extremities. Other symptoms include a high fever, conjunctivitis (red, inflamed eyes), cough, and nasal congestion. The Health Department must be notified on first suspicion. With our present immunization laws, measles is a rare occurrence today. It is imperative, however, that immunization records be kept current.
Mode of transmission: Direct contact with nose and throat secretions of an infected person. May be airborne by droplets of these secretions coughed into the air. Tiny droplets can be suspended in the air for two hours or more. Measles is very easily spread.
Notification: Notify staff and parents/guardians that a case has occurred. Measles is a Class I reportable disease and there will be a follow-up investigation by the Health Department. Parents of children with weakened immune systems (those being treated for cancer, leukemia or taking steroid medication, etc.) should consult their child’s physician and keep the child out of the center until after the investigation by the Health Department and it is considered safe for them to return.
Return to child care: The child may return to child care when free of fever and the rash is fading (this usually takes 5-7 days).
MENINGITIS
Meningitis is an inflammation or infection of the meninges (the membranes that cover the brain and spinal cord). Meningitis can be caused by a variety of organisms or germs. Most people exposed to these germs do not develop meningitis or serious illness. Some people may carry a particular germ and have no symptoms at all. Anyone exhibiting signs and symptoms of meningitis (e.g., severe headache, fever, vomiting, stiffness and pain in the neck, shoulders and back, drowsiness) should seek medical attention promptly.

Meningitis is a reportable disease. The Department of Health evaluates each case individually to determine what public health intervention, if any, might be required. The two types of meningitis that require public health intervention most often are caused by the organisms Haemophilus influenza type b (HIB) and Neisseria meningitidis (meningococcal).
Mode of transmission: These germs are most commonly spread by direct contact with nose and throat secretions from an infected person.
Notification: Notify parents/guardians that a case has occurred and to have their children evaluated by a physician should they have any of the signs or symptoms listed above.
Return to child care: The child may return to the center whenever he or she has been released by his/her personal physician.
MUMPS
Mumps is an infectious disease that is characterized by swelling and pain of the salivary glands.
Mode of transmission: Person- to- person spread by direct contact with the saliva of an infected person.
Return to child care: The child may return to child care 9 days after the beginning of the salivary gland swelling.
“PINK EYE” (CONJUNCTIVITIS)
This is an infectious disease characterized by redness of the eye(s), excessive tearing, itching, and discharge. Some cases may require antibiotics; therefore, the child should see a physician.
Mode of transmission: Contact with discharges from the eye, nose, or throat of an infected person. Also, from contact with fingers, clothing and other articles that have been contaminated with the discharge.
Return to child care: Children may return to child care after they have seen a physician or when the redness/discharge is improving.
PINWORMS
Pinworms are tiny worms that live in the large intestine and can cause anal itching, sleeplessness and irritability. They may also be present without any symptoms. Pinworms occur worldwide and affect all socioeconomic classes. They are the most common worm infection in the United States. Prescription medication must be obtained to treat the infection.
Regulations Governing Licensure of Child Care Facilities
Amended July 12, 2017, Effective August 16, 2017
Office of Health Protection Child Care Facilities Licensure Division
15

Mode of transmission: Pinworms can be spread when an uninfected person touches the anal area of an infected person and then puts their hands/fingers in their mouth. They can also be spread when an infected person scratches the anal area and then contaminates food or other objects that are touched or eaten. Pinworms can be spread as long as the worms or the eggs are present.
Return to child care: The child may return to child care 24 hours after they have received the first treatment. Employ thorough hand washing especially before eating and after toilet use and change and wash any bed linens and towels in hot water that have been used for those children. Ask the parents/guardians to do the same at home. Also, discourage children from scratching the anal area.
RESPIRATORY SYNCYTIAL VIRUS (RSV)
RSV can cause an upper respiratory disease like a cold or a disease of the lower respiratory tract such as pneumonia. It is the most common cause of lower respiratory tract infections and pneumonia in infants and children under the age of 2. Almost 100% of children in child care programs get RSV during the first year of life. This usually occurs during outbreaks in the winter months. RSV can range from a very mild disease to life-threatening.
Mode of transmission: Direct contact with nose and throat secretions of an infected person. A young child can be infectious with RSV 1 to 3 weeks after signs and symptoms have subsided.
Return to child care: Most of the time a child is infectious before signs and symptoms appear. An infected child does not need to be excluded from child care unless he/she has a fever and/or is not well enough to participate in the activities. Make sure that procedures pertaining to hand washing, proper disposal of tissues and disinfection of toys are followed.
RINGWORM
Ringworm is a skin infection caused by a fungus that can affect the scalp, skin, fingers, toe nails, and feet. Ringworm anyplace except on the scalp or under the nails can be successfully treated with several over-the-counter medicines. Ringworm of the scalp is characterized by inflammation, redness, and hair loss and does not respond to over-the-counter medicines; therefore, the child should see his/her physician.
Mode of transmission: Direct skin-to-skin contact or indirect contact (e.g., toilet articles such as combs and hair brushes, used towels, clothing and hats contaminated with hair from infected persons or animals).
Notification: When the lesions (red, circular places) are found, notify the parent/guardian that the child needs treatment.
Return to child care: The child may return to child care after the treatment has been started. Treatment for ringworm of the scalp and nails usually lasts for several weeks. Strict infection control measures should be taken (e.g., blankets, towels or anything that is used on the infected child

should not be used on another child, make sure that staff caring for these children practice good hand washing and that disinfecting procedures are followed.
SCABIES
Scabies is a disease of the skin caused by a mite. The mite burrows beneath the skin and causes a rash that is usually found around finger webs, wrists, and elbows. The rash may appear on the head, neck, and body on infants. Any child with evidence of severe itching especially in these areas should be referred to his/her physician. Scabies requires treatment by prescription drugs.
Mode of transmission: Direct skin-to-skin contact with an infested person. Transfer of the mites from undergarments and bedclothes can occur, but only if contact takes place immediately after the infested person has been in contact with the undergarments and bedclothes.
Notification: Notify parents/guardians and staff that scabies has occurred in the facility so that they can be alert to signs and symptoms and seek treatment.
Return to child care: The child may return to child care 24 hours after the treatment has been completed. It must be noted that itching may continue for several days, but this does not indicate treatment failure or that the child should be sent home.
“STREP THROAT” (STREPTOCOCCAL PHARYNGITIS) & SCARLET FEVER
Strep throat is a communicable disease characterized by sore throat, fever, and tender, swollen lymph glands in the neck. The child should see a physician to obtain prescription medication; this is quite important to avoid the risk of complications involving the heart and kidneys. Scarlet fever is a streptococcal infection with a rash (scarlatinaform rash). It is most commonly associated with strep throat. In addition to the signs and symptoms of strep throat, the person with scarlet fever has an inflamed, sandpaper-like rash and sometimes a very red or “strawberry” tongue. The rash is due to a toxin produced by the infecting strain of bacteria. The treatment and exclusion criteria for scarlet fever would be the same as for strep throat.
Mode of transmission: Direct or indirect contact (e.g., contaminated hands, drinking glasses, straws) with throat secretions of an infected person.
Return to child care: The child may return to child care 24 hours after treatment has been started if free of fever.
TUBERCULOSIS (TB)
Mode of transmission: Airborne droplets of respiratory secretions coughed or sneezed into the air
by a person with active TB disease.
Regulations Governing Licensure of Child Care Facilities
Amended July 12, 2017, Effective August 16, 2017
Office of Health Protection Child Care Facilities Licensure Division
17

Notification: TB is a class one reportable disease. If a child or a staff member in a child care facility is diagnosed with active TB, the MSDH will conduct an investigation. The MSDH will notify the facility and the parents/guardians of the type of follow-up that will be necessary.
Return to child care: Persons diagnosed with TB infection are evaluated by the Mississippi State Department of Health on an individual basis. Those who have a positive TB skin test only may attend child care since they have no disease process that is contagious. Persons suspected of or diagnosed with active TB disease will need written permission from the Mississippi State Department of Health Tuberculosis Control Program to return to the center.
Small children are highly susceptible to contracting TB disease, but do not transmit the disease as easily as an older child or adult. Children who do not have active TB disease, but who have been exposed to an active case in their household are considered high risk contacts and are placed on preventive medication. These children may attend child care since they are not infectious.
WHOOPING COUGH (PERTUSSIS)
Pertussis or whooping cough is a contagious disease characterized by upper respiratory tract symptoms with a cough, often with a characteristic inspiratory (breathing in) whoop.
Mode of transmission: Direct or indirect contact (contaminated articles) with nose and throat secretions of an infected person. Airborne transmission can also occur by droplets of these secretions coughed into the air.
Notification: Notify parents/guardians that a case has occurred. Pertussis is a class one reportable disease. The Health Department will conduct an investigation to determine those who may need preventive treatment.
Return to child care: The child may return to child care 5 days after their treatment has begun.

PERMISSION TO COLLECT STOOL SPECIMENS AND RECEIVE TEST RESULTS
If and when an outbreak of diarrheal diseases such as giardiasis, salmonellosis, shigellosis, etc. occurs in a child care facility, the Mississippi State Department (MSDH) investigates and may request that stool specimens be collected. In an outbreak situation, the stool specimen collection bottles are provided by the MSDH and the tests are done in the MSDH Lab free of charge. The collection bottle, with instructions, would either be given to the parent/guardian to collect the stool specimen or it may need to be collected at the child care facility. The child care facility would receive the test results and recommendations would be made by the MSDH. The test results would be given to the parents/guardians by the child care facility and the parents/guardians should give them to their child’s physician.
I give my permission for (name of child care facility) to collect stool specimens from (name of child) when it is recommended by the MSDH and also for them to receive the test results. I understand that I will receive a copy of the test results and be informed of the recommendations made by the MSDH.

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE CONTROL OF HEAD LICE IN THE CHILD CARE SETTING
Head lice, Pediculus humanus capitis, are a common problem in children who attend child care in Mississippi. Although they do not transmit any human disease, they may be a considerable nuisance, and require conscious effort on the part of the child care staff and parents to control. It should be understood that head lice can only be controlled in the child care center, not eliminated; they will occur sporadically, and will recur even after control efforts. The goal of control efforts is to reduce the problem and its impact, and minimize spread.
Head lice are not a product of poor personal hygiene or lack of cleanliness and their presence is not a reflection on the child care center or the family. More harm is probably caused by misconceptions about head lice than by the lice themselves.
1. IDENTIFYING INFESTED CHILDREN
By Screening: It is important to establish a screening program. Children should be screened for head lice upon entry into the child care setting and periodically during the year. Staff members should be instructed in the technique of detecting head lice.
By Individual Case: Any child suspected of having head lice (usually because he/she is scratching his/her head a lot) should be examined by a staff member who has been instructed in the technique. If infested, the child should be handled as described in Section 2, "HANDLING OF INFESTED CHILDREN."
If one child in a room is found to be infested, the whole room should be screened.
2. HANDLING OF INFESTED CHILDREN
Exclusion: An infested child’s parent/guardians should be notified that the child has been found to have head lice and must receive the proper treatment before returning to child care. Treatment and removal of nits are described in Section 3, "TREATMENT." Care must be taken not to embarrass or stigmatize the child.
Return to Child Care: The child should return to the child care center as soon as the first treatment has been given. Nits (eggs) may still be seen even in an adequately treated child. This is not evidence of continuing infestation if the child has been properly treated and no adult lice are present.
3. TREATMENT
Individual: Several effective pediculicides (lice-killing products) are available such as Nix®* (permethrin) creme rinse (10 minute hair rinse) which is available over the counter and has ovicidal (egg or nit-killing) capability. It is the only over-the-counter pediculicide covered by Medicaid. The pyrethrin/pyrinate products (10 minute shampoos) include such products as Rid®*, A-1000®*, R&C®*, Clear®* and Triple-X®* and are available over the counter at pharmacies. Kwell®* (1%

lindane), a 4 minute shampoo, requires a prescription. Central nervous system toxicity with lindane has been documented with prolonged administration. Ovide®* lotion (Malathion 0.5%) has been re- approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a prescription drug for the treatment of head lice infestation in the United States. Treatment with any approved pediculicidal (lice-killing) product should be adequate.
One Treatment vs. Two Treatments: Most products require 2 treatments. An initial treatment will kill adult and larval lice, but will not kill all the eggs. A second treatment 7 to 10 days later, after the eggs left by the first treatment have all hatched, will kill the newly hatched lice before they mature and reproduce and will complete the treatment process. Nix®* requires only one treatment since it is an ovicidal (also kills the eggs or nits); however, a second treatment is desirable since the product is not likely to kill 100% of the nits. Ovide®* lotion is also ovicidal and requires a second treatment 7 to 10 days after the first one only if crawling lice are seen.
Retreatment: Pediculicides should kill lice soon after application. However, in some situations (e.g., a person is too heavily infested, pediculicide is used incorrectly, reinfestation or possible resistance to the medication), the lice may still be present. Immediate retreatment with a different class or type of pediculicide is generally recommended if live lice are detected on the scalp 24 hours or longer after the initial treatment.
Treatment of Infants and Children Less Than 2 Years of Age: It is a rare occurrence for children in this age group to have head lice. It is generally not recommended to treat this age group preventively or just because someone else in the family has been treated. If a child of this age is found to have head lice, the parent/guardian should consult the child’s physician for treatment. The safety of head lice medications has not been tested in children 2 years of age and under.
Removal of nits: The need to remove nits is somewhat controversial. However, removing the nits may prevent reinfestation by those nits hatching that may have been missed by the treatment. It may also decrease confusion about infestation when the person who has been treated is being re- examined for the presence of head lice, and it will avoid possible embarrassment to the infested child. Nits may be removed by the use of a nit comb or by manually (“nit-picking”) removing them. Most of the nits that are easily seen and more easily removed with the nit comb are those that are grayish-white in color, have grown out one or more inches on the hair shaft and have already hatched. The new, viable nits are closer to the scalp (within about 1/4 inch) and are more of a brownish color. These nits are firmly attached to the hair shaft with a glue-like substance. There are commercial products available to help loosen the glue-like substance for easier removal.
Family: Household members of a child with head lice should be examined for lice (by a family member who knows how or someone else knowledgeable about lice) and any infested persons treated as described above. The one exception is any person over 2 years of age who shares a bed with the infested child should simply be treated presumptively. If the child is less than 2 years of age, consult the child’s physician for treatment recommendations.

4. ENVIRONMENTAL CONTROL
Child Care Facility/Household: Clothing, cloth toys, and personal linens (such as towels and bedclothes used within the previous 48 hours by an infested person) can be disinfected by washing in hot water and drying in the dryer using hot cycles. Non-washables should be dry cleaned, or stored in airtight plastic bags for 2 weeks. Spraying with insecticides is NOT recommended. Fumigants and room sprays can be toxic if inhaled or absorbed through the skin. If there are cloth surfaces, such as furniture or carpet, with which the infested person's hair has had extensive contact, they should be vacuumed thoroughly. The head louse will not survive off the human scalp for more than 24 - 48 hours.
                                   ************
Questions about control methods, specific treatments, or special problems can be addressed to the local health department, the district public health office, or to the Office of Community Health Services - Division of Epidemiology, State Department of Health in Jackson.

SAMPLE LETTER TO PARENTS/GUARDIANS
Dear Parent or Guardian:
Your child has been found to have head lice. Head lice do not transmit disease and they are not a result of lack of cleanliness. Children in child care settings get them commonly, sometimes more than once.
You should consult a pharmacist or your child’s physician for a recommendation as to which of several effective products to use to treat your child. As soon as you have treated your child with an approved pediculicidal (lice-killing) product, he or she may return to child care.
There are 3 steps in the successful management of head lice:
1. Treatment (killing the lice with an approved medical treatment) - It is very important to follow the instructions given by your physician when using prescription medication. If you use over-the-counter medication, you should follow the package directions. The other members of your family should be checked for head lice and treated if they are found to have them. Persons over 2 years of age who sleep in the same bed with the infested child should be treated regardless. If a child less than 2 years of age is found to have head lice, consult the child’s physician for treatment recommendations.
2. Removal of the nits - The Mississippi State Department of Health recommends that you attempt to remove the nits to avoid reinfestation by those nits hatching that may have been missed by the treatment. The nits can be removed by dividing the hair into sections and working each section separately. Look for small grayish-white or yellowish-brown specks that are attached to the hair shaft close to the scalp. Nits are attached to the hair shaft very firmly with a glue-like substance and are not easily brushed out. They must be picked out with the fingernails or combed with the nit comb that usually comes with the lice-killing product. This can be done outdoors under bright sunlight or indoors with a good reading lamp as nits are sometimes hard to see.
3. Environmental control - Clothing and personal linens (such as towels and bedclothes used by infested persons) should be machine washed using hot water and dried using the hot cycle. Non-washables can be dry cleaned or stored in an airtight plastic bag for 2 weeks. Cloth- covered furniture and carpet that have been in extensive contact with an infested person’s head should be thoroughly vacuumed. Lice-killing sprays are generally not necessary.
