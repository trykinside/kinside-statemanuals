a. An offense described in North Dakota Century Code chapter 12.1-16, homicide; 12.1-18, kidnapping; 12.1-27.2, sexual performances by children; or 12.1-41, Uniform Act on Prevention of and Remedies for Human Trafficking; or in North Dakota Century Code section 12.1-17-01, simple assault; 12.1-17-01.1, assault; 12.1-17-02, aggravated assault; 12.1-17-03, reckless endangerment; 12.1-17-04, terrorizing; 12.1-17-06, criminal coercion; 12.1-17-07.1, stalking; 12.1-17-12, assault or homicide while fleeing a police officer; 12.1-20-03, gross sexual imposition; 12.1-20-03.1, continuous sexual abuse of a child; 12.1-20-04, sexual imposition; 12.1-20-05, corruption or solicitation of minors; 12.1-20-05.1, luring minors by computer or other electronic means; 12.1-20-06, sexual abuse of wards; 12.1-20-07, sexual assault; 12.1-21-01, arson; 12.1-22-01, robbery; 12.1-22-02, burglary, if a class B felony under subdivision b of subsection 2 of that section; 12.1-29-01, promoting prostitution; 12.1-29-02, facilitating prostitution; 12.1-31-05, child procurement; 14-09-22, abuse of child; or 14-09-22.1, neglect of child;

If a person is excused from providing fingerprints, the department may conduct a nationwide name-based criminal history record investigation in any state in which the person lived during the eleven years preceding the signed authorization for the background check.
6. Review of fingerprint-based criminal history record check results.

If a services-required determination under North Dakota Century Code chapter 50-25.1 or a similar finding in another jurisdiction which requires proof of substantially similar elements exists, indicating that any child has been abused or neglected by the applicant, provider, emergency designee, staff member, or household member, the applicant or provider shall furnish information satisfactory to the department, from which the department can determine the applicant's, provider's, or staff member's ability to provide care that is free of abuse and neglect.
