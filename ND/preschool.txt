6. Review of fingerprint-based criminal history record check results.
a. If an individual disputes the results of the criminal history record check required under this chapter, the individual may request a review of the results by submitting a written request for review to the department within thirty calendar days of the date of the department's memo outlining the results. The individual's request for review must include a statement of each disputed item and the reason for the dispute.
b. The department shall assign the individual's request for review to a department review panel. An individual who has requested a review may contact the department for an informal conference regarding the review any time before the department has issued its final decision.

If, upon reinspection, the department or its authorized agent determines that the preschool has not corrected a violation identified in the correction order, the department or its authorized agent shall mail a notice of
