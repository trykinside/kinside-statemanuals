TITLE 391 CHILDREN’S SERVICES LICENSING CHAPTER 2 FAMILY CHILD CARE HOME II
2-001 SCOPE AND AUTHORITY: These regulations will become operative three months after their effective date. These regulations govern the licensing of family child care homes by the Department of Health and Human Services. Statutory authority for these regulations is in:
1. The Child Care Licensing Act (Neb. Rev. Stat. §§ 71-1908 to 71-1923);
2. The Child Protection Act (Neb. Rev. Stat. §§ 28-710 to 28-727);
3. The Clean Indoor Air Act (Neb. Rev. Stat. §§ 71-5716 to 71-5734);
4. The Quality Child Care Act (Neb. Rev. Stat. §§ 43-2601 to 43-2625);
5. The Sex Offender Registration Act (Neb. Rev. Stat. §§ 29-4001 to 29-4014); and
6. Neb. Rev. Stat. §§ 4-108 to 4-114.
The Child Care Licensing Act requires the Department to develop regulations establishing standards for the physical well-being, safety, and protection of children in programs licensed under the Act. The purposes of the Act are to provide statewide licensure standards for persons providing child care programs and to provide the Department with authority to coordinate the enforcement of standards on licensees. The standards ensure that programs are providing proper care for and treatment of the children served, and that the care and treatment are consistent with the children’s physical well-being, safety, and protection.
The Child Protection Act authorizes the Department to use information in the state child abuse/neglect central register for purposes of licensing providers of child care programs, and the Clean Indoor Air Act addresses smoking in licensed child care programs.
The Quality Child Care Act requires the Department to develop regulations for mandatory training requirements for child care providers designed to meet the health, safety, and developmental needs of children and tailored to the needs of licensed providers. The Act states that the Legislature’s intent is to encourage high-quality, affordable, and accessible child care services that are educationally and age-appropriate.
The Sex Offender Registration Act authorizes the disclosure of information to providers who serve children for the purpose of conducting confidential background checks for employment.
