Using the Rulebook
There are many sections of the rulebook, some you’ll use on a daily basis, and others you will reference only occasionally. The best way to start is to review the rulebook in its entirety to get a sense of what is here. Then carefully read the sections that affect your daily work. Reference the book when you are starting a new or unfamiliar process, such as your license renewal application or making changes to your program. All staff members should have knowledge of and access to the rules, so please share them. We are here to help, so if you ever have a question just ask us.
The rulebook can be a great resource and training tool. As we move forward with our plans, we will be providing interpretive guide pages to ensure a common understanding of the rules. The rule can be printed out and placed in a binder, and as the interpretive guides are released, they too can be added to the appropriate sections. When using the PDF version, you can quickly search for certain words within the rule to find the information you need, as well as selecting what section you want in the Table of Contents and immediately be brought to it.
This is a book for providers; so if you need something, let us know. We also ask that you go to our website regularly for updates, tools and other information.
