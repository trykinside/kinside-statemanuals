Inspect and examine the physical plant or facilities, including, but not limited to, storage areas and additional floor levels, and program of a child care center without delay or an escort, and inspect all documents, records, files, or other data maintained pursuant to the above-referenced law during the center's normal operating hours and without prior notice; and
3. Request the appropriate State and local fire, health and building officials to conduct examinations and inspections to determine a center's compliance with State and local ordinances, codes and regulations. The inspections shall be conducted and the results reported to the Department within 60 days after the request.
(c) Under the laws specified in (a) above, the Department of Children and Families is authorized to issue a Certificate of Life/Safety Approval to a center that:

2. Was operating on or before May 16, 1984 and was exempt from the licensing provisions because it was operated by an aid society of a properly organized and accredited church.
(d) Centers specified in (c)1 and 2 above are required to comply with the physical facility; life/safety; administration and control of medication; environmental sanitation; supervision, minimum staffing, and discipline requirements; and communicable disease reporting provisions of this chapter. Centers with Certificates of Life/Safety Approval may secure regular licenses on a voluntary basis, as long as they comply with all provisions of this chapter.
(e) To be eligible for a license, a center shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Department of Children and Families, or the duly authorized agency, that the center complies with all applicable provisions of this chapter.
(f) All applicable requirements shall be met by all child care centers, unless the rules are specified as "for early childhood programs" or "for school-age child care programs."
(g) Responsibility for ensuring that centers comply with the provisions of the laws cited in (a) above and with provisions of this chapter is hereby delegated by the Department of Children and Families to the Office of Licensing.
1

(h) When a person intends to care for six or more children under 13 years of age, he or she shall apply for and secure from the Office of Licensing a license to operate a child care center. Once licensed, the center is subject to all applicable provisions of this chapter, even if the number or ages of the children attending the center at a particular time should fall outside the definition of a center, as specified in N.J.A.C. 3A:52-1.2(a).
(i) The Office cannot complete initial program inspections unless six or more children are present at the center.

1. For a facility that is located in a sponsor’s or sponsor representative's home, the Office of Licensing shall not count the children residing in the sponsor’s or sponsor representative's home in determining whether the facility is serving the minimum number of children that would require it to be licensed as a center.

(c) The term “child care center” shall not include the following programs, since they do not meet the definition of a child care center:

3. A child care program operating within a geographic area, enclave or facility that is owned or operated by the Federal government;
4. A family day care home that is registered pursuant to the Family Day Care Provider Registration Law, N.J.S.A. 30:5B-16 et seq.;

2

6. A program offering child care on an ad hoc, sporadic, and isolated basis in order to meet an emergency or special need, such as during emergency school closings, conferences, or training sessions.
3A:52-1.3 Programs exempt from licensure
(a) The following programs are exempt from licensure pursuant to the laws specified in N.J.A.C. 3A:52-1.1(a):

2. Kindergartens, pre-kindergarten programs, or child care centers that are operated by and are an integral part of, a private educational institution or system providing elementary education in grades kindergarten through sixth;
i. For purposes of this paragraph, operation of a program by a private educational institution or system shall require direct operation and payment of staff by the operating institution or system.
ii. For purposes of this paragraph, a program is an integral part of a private educational institution or system if the program and the institution or system can reasonably demonstrate integration of the program based on geographic proximity, commonality of enrollment, and continuation of enrollment between the program and the institution or system, commonality of staffing, cohesion of an academic curriculum between programs, or some combination of the above.
