ODJFS has also amended rules to implement Amended Substitute Senate Bill No. 99 of the 131st General Assembly which were previously detailed in Child Care Center Manual Procedure Letter No. 16.
The following rules and form will be effective October 29, 2017.
Amended rules:
5101:2-12-07 "Administrator responsibilities, requirements and qualifications for a licensed child care center" outlines the education and responsibilities required to become an administrator in a licensed child care center. This rule has been amended to clarify when an administrator for programs that operate overnight/weekends has to be on-site. Appendix B to this rule has been amended to clarify the breastfeeding policy requirements and to specify that the requirement is only for programs that serve infants or toddlers.
5101:2-12-08 "Employee and child care staff member requirements in a licensed child care center" outlines the qualifications required for employees and child care staff members in a licensed child care center. This rule has been amended to clarify that the child care staff orientation does not have to be retaken if the staff changes programs or owners. This rule was also amended to remove language that required child care staff members already employed to complete the online orientation by June 30, 2017.
5101:2-12-10 "Training and professional development requirements for a licensed child care center" outlines the initial and on-going training and professional development requirements for child care center staff. This rule has been amended to remove paragraph (A)(3) that required administrators, child care staff members, including substitutes, to complete the one-hour child abuse and neglect training by June 30, 2017. This rule was also amended to clarify that the training document only has to be given to employees if it is not stored in the Ohio Professional Registry (OPR) and to require the one hour child abuse training be taken within the first 60 days of employment instead of the first 30 days.
5101:2-12-12 "Safe equipment and environment for a licensed child care center" outlines the requirements for safe equipment and environments in a licensed child care center. This rule has been amended to update the weapons language to implement the changes to Ohio's Concealed Carry law as required by Amended Substitute Senate Bill No. 99 of the 131st General Assembly.
5101:2-12-13 "Sanitary equipment and environment for a licensed child care center" outlines the requirements for sanitary equipment and environments for a licensed child care center. Appendix B to this rule has been amended to remove the 15 second requirement to wash hands, to remove the requirement that staff must wash hands when moving from one group to another or after removing disposable gloves, to add that staff must wash hands when visibly soiled and to allow the use of hand sanitizer for staff and all children over 24 months.

5101:2-12-18 "Group size and ratios for a licensed child care center" outlines the requirements for staff to child ratios and grouping in a licensed child care center. This rule has been amended to clarify that programs are no longer required to document on the daily attendance records the schedule of transitioning children and an additional employee or child care staff member is only needed to be onsite if there are seven or more children present. This rule has also been amended to allow school-age programs to leave children at double ratio to answer the door, to clarify that attendance records for in and out times are only required at the program level (not group), to allow flexibility in tracking group attendance and to remove the language prohibiting bumping children to maintain ratio. Although bumping is not best practice for the children, it is an issue to be addressed between the center and caretaker(s).
5101:2-12-23 "Infant care and diaper care for a licensed child care center" outlines requirements when caring for infants in a licensed child care center. This rule has been amended to remove the requirement that programs ensure that each child has a clean supply of diapers and an extra change of clothing available at all times.

Child Care Center Transmittal Letter No. 17
October 17, 2017 All Child Care Center Manual Holders
Cynthia C. Dungey, Director
Background Check Rule Revisions for Child Care Centers
The Office of Family Assistance has amended child care center licensing rules pertaining to background checks as a result of the Child Care Development Block Grant Act (CCDBG) of 2014. Federal law requires the following five background checks be completed for each individual who owns, works or applies to work in a child care program:
• Bureau of Criminal Investigation (BCI)
• Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)
• National Sex Offender Registry
• State Sex Offender Registry
• Statewide Automated Child Welfare Information System (SACWIS).
The Federal Law requires that all background check results be reviewed by the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services (ODJFS). In addition, individuals will no longer be required to complete new background checks if they change employers within a specified timeframe.
Licensing rules have also been amended as a result of feedback received from the Ohio Alliance of Early Learning Advocates in November 2016 and from stakeholder meetings held on January 31, 2017 and March 17, 2017.
The following rules and forms will be effective October 29, 2017.
New rule:
5101:2-12-09 "Background check requirements for a licensed child care center" has been replaced as a new rule due to the number of revisions and rearrangement of the paragraphs and to update the appendix to include language regarding sealed records. This rule outlines the new background check requirements that must be completed before working in a child care center. Appendix A to the rule has been amended to clarify that for rehabilitation, three years does not need to elapse for misdemeanors that are sealed and ten years does not need to elapse for felonies that are sealed.
Amended rules:
5101:2-12-01 "Definitions for licensed child care centers" defines the terms used throughout the chapter of center licensing rules. This rule has been amended to add language to the definition of child care.
5101:2-12-02 "Application and amendments for a child care center license" outlines the process and requirements for applying for a child care center license and the process to amend a currently existing child care center license. Appendix A to this rule has been amended to reflect the updated requirements for background checks that are to be submitted at the time of application. Additionally, building approval documentation requirements were clarified in the appendix.
5101:2-12-03 "Compliance inspection and complaint investigation of a licensed child care center" outlines guidelines and timeframes for inspections and investigations of licensed child care centers. This rule has been amended to clarify language regarding types of inspections. The appendix to this rule has also been amended with updated language to reflect the new background check process (rule 5101:2-12-09), the updated concealed weapons requirements in Ohio (rule 5101:2-12-12), and to clarify the moderate risk noncompliance for using vehicles that do not meet the requirements of rule 5101:2-12-14 of the Administrative Code (rule 5101:2-12-14).

FROM: SUBJECT: Background:

5101:2-12-05 "Denial, revocation and suspension of a licensed child care center application or license" outlines the parameters for denying an application or revoking or suspending a child care center license. This rule has been amended to include the updated background check requirements for denying or revoking a license.
New forms:
JFS 01175 "Request for a Background Check for Child Care" is a new form that will be used by individuals to request a background check to work in child care.
JFS 01176 "Program Notification of Background Check Review for Child Care" is a new form that will be used to inform child care programs of background check results for applicants, owners, employees and child care staff members.
JFS 01177 "Individual Notification of Background Check Review for Child Care" is a new form that will be used to inform individuals if the results of their background check allow them to be an owner, employee or child care staff member in a center.
JFS 01178 "Request for Review of Background Check Decision for Child Care" is a new form that will be completed by an individual to appeal the results of their background check.
Amended forms:
JFS 01247 "Inspection Report for Child Care Centers" has been revised to update the rules included in this package as well as the following rules being amended in a separate package:
• 5101:2-12-07
• 5101:2-12-08
• 5101:2-12-10
• 5101:2-12-12
• 5101:2-12-13
• 5101:2-12-14
• 5101:2-12-16
• 5101:2-12-18
• 5101:2-12-23
• 5101:2-12-25
Obsolete forms:
JFS 01206 "Rehabilitation Criteria"
JFS 01328 "Statement of Nonconviction for Child Care" Implementation:
New Program:
Any program that applies for a license after the effective date of these rules shall follow the new background check process.
New Staff:
Any employee or child care staff member of currently licensed programs hired after the effective date of the rules shall follow the new background check process.
Current Staff:
Current owners, administrators, employees and child care staff members as of the effective date of these rules will be phased-in to the new process.
   
Itinerant teachers who are left alone with children and/or used to meet ratio or group size will now need files on site at the program (including background checks pursuant to rule 5101:2-12-09). The Ohio Department of Education itinerant teacher form will no longer be accepted to meet the requirements for background checks, medical statements or education verification.
Each program shall send the following to CCBackgroundCheck@jfs.ohio.gov by January 1, 2018:
• A cover sheet detailing each person and their role within the program (owner, administrator, child care staff member or employee). JFS 01171 "Background Check Cover Sheet for Child Care" is a sample form that can be used to meet this requirement.
• JFS 01175 for each owner, administrator, child care staff member and employee.
• Copies of current BCI and FBI results on file for each employee and child care staff member at the program. Each program must keep the original copy of the results on file until it receives the new JFS 01176 for each employee and child care staff member.
• If an individual's BCI and FBI checks expire prior to January 1, 2018, that individual will follow the entire new process for background checks detailed in rule 5101:2-12-09 by the expiration date of the checks instead of submitting the current (expiring) checks to ODJFS by January 1, 2018. The individual should be noted on the cover sheet as "requested new BCI and FBI checks."
• If an individual's BCI or FBI checks on file have already expired, were not sent directly to the licensed child care center, or were not run pursuant to section 5104.013 of the Ohio Revised Code (as noted on the results), the individual shall follow the new process for background checks detailed in rule 5101:2-12-09 instead of submitting the non-compliant checks on file to ODJFS. If the non-compliant checks are submitted to ODJFS, this may result in the program being cited a low risk noncompliance for failing to comply with rule 5101:2-12-09 of the Ohio Administrative Code. The individual should be noted on the cover sheet as "requested new BCI/FBI checks."
ODJFS will use these results along with the results from new child abuse and neglect checks and state and national sex offender registry checks to determine if the individual is eligible for continued employment. Each program and individual will receive notification from ODJFS regarding eligibility after review of the background check results. If ODJFS determines the person is not eligible to work in a child care program, the owner shall immediately terminate employment, unless the individual requests a review. If the individual requests a review, the individual cannot be on-site at the program during the review process.
Please contact the Child Care Policy Helpdesk at 1-877-302-2347, option 4, if you have any questions.

Five-Year Rule Review for Licensed Child Care Centers
In accordance with Ohio Revised Code (ORC) Section 119.032, each state agency is required to review its rules a minimum of once every five years. The intent of the law is to ensure that rules are clearly written and that program requirements are accurate, up-to-date and clearly expressed. To the extent possible, unnecessary paperwork will be eliminated and local agencies will be given increased flexibility. The purpose of a rule review is to determine whether a rule should be continued without amendment, be amended or be rescinded, taking into consideration each rule's scope and purpose.
A number of rules related to child care centers were recently reviewed and some changes were made. The following revisions will be effective December 1, 2011:
Rule 5101:2-12-21 "Care and Nurturing of Children in Licensed Child Care Centers." This rule has been revised to remove references to websites that list choking hazards and to replace it with an appendix to the rule which lists common food choking hazards.
Rule 5101:2-12-22 "Child Guidance and Management in Licensed Child Care Centers." This rule has been revised to clarify that child guidance must occur at the time of the incident.
Rule 5101:2-12-23 "Evening and Overnight Care in Licensed Child Care Centers." This rule has been revised to clarify who is to provide basic hygiene items.
Rule 5101:2-12-27 "Training in First Aid, CPR, Management of Communicable Disease and Child Abuse Prevention in Licensed Child Care Centers." This rule has been revised to separate the requirements for First Aid and Management of Communicable Disease and to clarify that the department will accept online training courses that have been reviewed and approved by ODJFS.
Rule 5101:2-12-28 "In-Service Training for Licensed Child Care Centers." This rule has been revised to update language regarding electronic media training and to clarify what online courses are to be accepted.
Rule 5101:2-12-34 "Medical, Dental, and General Emergency Plans for Licensed Child Care Centers." This rule is being revised to reflect that the JFS 01242 Medical/Dental/General Emergency Plan has been updated and to add the requirement that weather emergency drills be practiced monthly March through September. Additionally, the current appendix to this rule has been removed.
Rule 5101:2-12-35 "Incident/Injury Report for Licensed Child Care Centers." This rule is being revised to update the ways that a JFS 01299 can be submitted and to clarify programs responsibilities regarding reporting of serious incidents.
Rule 5101:2-12-36 "First Aid Supplies/Procedures for Licensed Child Care Centers." This rule is being revised to replace the requirement for "vinyl" gloves in the first aid kit to "non-latex" gloves. The language regarding having a system to review the first aid kit and replace missing items has also been removed.
Rule 5101:2-12-37 "Children's Medical and Enrollment Records for Licensed Child Care Centers." This rule has been revised to include a Certified Nurse Practitioner (CNP) as a health care provider whom can sign off on a child's medical statement.
Rule 5101:2-12-38 "Care of Children with Health Conditions in Licensed Child Care Centers." This rule has been revised to define who is required to have a Medical/Physical Care Plan on file and what information must be included in that plan.

Rule Revisions for Licensed Child Care Centers
This letter is to notify stakeholders that the five rules listed below have been revised to improve the process for obtaining an initial license and renewing a license. These rules are effective September 29, 2011. The following is a summary of the changes to the rules:
Rule 5101:2-12-18.1 "Transportation/Vehicle Requirements for Licensed Child Care Centers" has been amended to clarify the intent of the rule requirements. The changes to the rule are to simplify language so it is clearly understood that appropriate child safety restraints must be used in vehicles used to transport children, when the vehicle is required by the United States Department of Transportation to be equipped with seat belts at the time of manufacture. This rule does not require school busses to have seat belts or to use child safety restraints.
Rule 5101:2-12-18.2 "Transportation/Driver Requirements for Licensed Child Care Centers" has been amended to simplify the record keeping requirements for contracted drivers who provide services to child care centers. The change to the rule requires the center to have the driver's employer complete a JFS 01266 "Contracted Driver Qualification Statement." This one form replaces the numerous documents contracted drivers currently must provide to the center.
Rule 5101:2-12-25 "Employee and Child Care Staff Member Requirements for Licensed Child Care Centers" has been amended as a result of the Five Year Review and to simplify the requirements for information that child care staff are required to have on file at the center. The changes to this rule include removing language requiring employees that have been home schooled to submit a letter from their local board of education or state board of education verifying they have met high school graduation requirements. This rule is also being amended to remove the requirement that child care staff members receive a tuberculosis test as part of the employee medical and to specify when all employees must receive the Pertussis immunization. Additionally, the requirement that each employee provide three references has been removed.
Rule 5101:2-12-26 "Statement of Nonconviction and Criminal Records Check for Licensed Child Care Centers" has been amended to clarify which employees of a child care center must have the results of a criminal records check on file at the center. The changes to this rule include clarification that persons providing contracted driving services may have their criminal records checks verified by a written statement from their employer rather than having a copy of the information on file at the child care center.
Rule 5101:2-12-42 "Cribs in Licensed Child Care Programs" has been amended to clarify the requirements for dividers between cribs and to implement the new federal standards for cribs. The changes to the rule include broadening the requirements for what type of material may be used for dividers between cribs and to reflect changes made to federal requirements regarding crib construction standards. The revision date of the JFS 01235 "Sleep Position Waiver" has been updated.
The electronic version of the Child Care Center Manual is located at: http://emanuals.odjfs.state.oh.us/emanuals . The manual contains all rules and transmittal letters that the department has issued to licensed child care centers. A current version of this manual should be accessible and utilized by all providers in all licensed child care centers.

Rule 5101:2-12-04 "Initial Application and Issuance of a Provisional License for Child Care Centers." This rule has been amended to define a "continuous license." Programs will no longer need to reapply every two years to have their licenses renewed. After the center completes the provisional period, the license will continue as a regular license without an expiration date, unless the program demonstrates that it cannot operate in compliance with the licensing rules. The rule has also been amended to increase the initial application fee, to extend the provisional period to twelve months and to add language regarding the application process.
Rule 5101:2-12-04.1 "Procedures for Child Care Centers Operating Under a Provisional License." This rule is a new rule which explains the requirements for compliance inspections during the provisional period, what happens at the end of the provisional period and under what circumstances a license may be proposed for revocation during the provisional period. An appendix has been added to this rule to detail sanctions that may be taken for serious risk noncompliances found during the provisional period.
Rule 5101:2-12-05 "License Amendments for Licensed Child Care Centers." This rule has been amended to revise the title of the rule, to remove language regarding initial applications and to move that language to 5101:2-12-04, and to detail the process for requesting an amendment to a child care license.
Rule 5101:2-12-06 "Procedures for Renewal of a Child Care Center License." This rule has been rescinded as a result of the change to a continuous license for child care.
Rule 5101:2-12-07 "Inspection and Investigation of Licensed and Unlicensed Child Care Centers."

Rule 5101:2-12-09 "Denial or Revocation of a Child Care Center Application or License." This rule has been amended to remove language about renewal of a license and to increase the number of years required to pass before someone who has had their license revoked can apply again for a child care license.
Rule 5101:2-12-10 "Building Approval for Licensed Child Care Centers." This rule has been amended to include the requirement that the center follow any stipulations or limitations that the building inspection department indicates on the report.
Rule 5101:2-12-11 "Fire Department Approval for Licensed Child Care Centers." This rule has been amended to specify that a center must secure a new fire inspection approval if the program changes location.
                     
Rule 5101:2-12-20 "Supervision, Staff/Child Ratios and Grouping for Licensed Child Care Centers." This rule has been amended to clarify supervision standards, to revise the requirement for employing adequate numbers of staff for the center's license capacity, to update the revision date of the JFS 01238 and to clarify attendance policies.
Rule 5101:2-12-24 "Administrator Responsibilities and Qualifications for Licensed Child Care Centers." This rule has been amended to increase the number of qualifications that a person must have to qualify as a child care administrator and to allow an additional year for the administrator to meet the second part of the qualifications. This rule has also been amended to increase the ways that an administrator may meet the education qualifications.
Rule 5101:2-12-30 "Written Information, Policies and Procedures to be Provided to Parents/Guardians of Children in Licensed Child Care Centers." This rule has been amended to include the specifics of the parental participation policy language from 5101:2-12-32. The revision date of the JFS 1237 has also been updated.
Rule 5101:2-12-32 "Parental Participation Policies and Parent Roster Requirements in Licensed Child Care Centers." This rule has been rescinded as the statutory requirement for child care centers to prepare and maintain a parent roster has been removed.

Beginning September 2019, all JFS 01175s shall be submitted via the OPR. Programs cannot create accounts and submit or sign the JFS 01175 on behalf of staff or employees. Profiles in the OPR must be owned and controlled by the individual staff or employees. Also in September 2019, programs will be required to link employees to their program in the OPR and keep all individuals currently employed by the program linked to the program. Programs should begin this process now to ensure compliance by next fall.

TO: FROM: SUBJECT:
January 19, 2018 All Child Care Center Manual Holders
Cynthia C. Dungey, Director
Requesting to be an Approved Training Organization for Communicable Disease for Child Care Programs
Background:
This letter is to provide notification of the process to become an approved training organization as set forth in rules 5101:2-12-10, 5101:2-13-10 and 5101:2-14-03 of the Administrative Code. The process allows for training organizations to be considered as "an ODJFS approved health organization," which allows the training conducted by these organizations to fulfill the requirements set forth in rule. Currently, an individual trainer must be one of the following:
• Licensed Registered Nurse;
• Physician; or
• Authorized communicable disease trainer for an Ohio Department of Job and Family Services
(ODJFS) approved health organization.
Updated Approval Process:
ODJFS has clarified the procedure outlined in rule for organizations wishing to be recognized as an ODJFS approved health organization to provide the ODJFS/Ohio Department of Health (ODH) approved communicable disease curriculum used by child care programs.
In order for an organization to be recognized as an ODJFS approved health organization for communicable disease training, the organization must submit the following information to ODJFS at CCDTrainer- Registration@jfs.ohio.gov:
• Name
• Contact information (address, phone number, fax number and email address)
• Company website
The organization must provide proof of all the following information:
• The organization currently provides communicable disease training to other agencies;
• A licensed nurse (RN) or physician is employed by the organization and is responsible for oversight of individuals who will be responsible for conducting the communicable disease
training; and
• Staff within the organization have been trained on communicable disease prevention either
through higher education coursework or through training offered within the organization.
Once all the required documents have been received, the ODJFS child care program office will review the information and inform the agency as to whether or not the agency has been approved to be recognized as an ODJFS approved health organization and will be added to the “At-a-Glance Training Chart” located on the website here http://jfs.ohio.gov/cdc/docs/TrainingChartCPR2017.stm. Health organizations that are already approved do not need to reapply.
An individual requesting to be an approved communicable disease trainer must submit the JFS 01278 “Communicable Disease Trainer Registration for Child Care” and one of the following:
• Proof of being a registered nurse or a licensed physician as outlined on the form;
• Proof of being an employee of an ODJFS approved health organization; or
• American Red Cross (ARC) Communicable Disease instructor card
 
• Note: Although ARC is no longer conducting communicable disease training for instructors, if an individual has previously received this card, he or she may still be approved as a communicable disease instructor.
The ODJFS will mail a compact disk with the ODJFS approved communicable disease training to an approved organization or individual.

Requirements for Carbon Monoxide Detectors
Effective December 31, 2016, Ohio Administrative Code (OAC) rules 5101:2-12-12 and 5101:2-13-12 required child care centers and family child care homes to have carbon monoxide (CO) detectors present in the program. At the time, the Ohio Fire Code did not address CO detectors for these settings. Effective December 15, 2017, the Ohio Fire Code will be amended to address the requirement for CO detectors for child care centers and Type A Home providers.
New Policy:
Effective December 15, 2017, the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services (ODJFS) will no longer assess compliance with OAC rules 5101:2-12-12 (B)(4) for centers and 5101:2-13-12 (B)(4) for Type A Homes. Since Type B Home providers are exempt from the Ohio Fire Code requirements and are not inspected by the State Fire Marshal's office, the ODJFS will continue to assess that these providers comply with the rule requirements for CO detectors.
Both rules will be amended to reflect these changes.

Implementation of New Weapons Requirements
Current licensing rules prohibit all weapons in child care centers and require family child care providers to keep weapons locked and out of sight of all children. Both centers and family child care providers are required by section 2923.1212 of the Ohio Revised Code (ORC) to display a sign that states "Unless otherwise authorized by law, pursuant to the Ohio Revised Code, no person shall knowingly possess, have under the person's control, convey, or attempt to convey a deadly weapon or dangerous ordnance onto these premises."
New Policy Requirements:
Effective March 21, 2017, Amended Substitute Senate Bill No. 199 of the 131st General Assembly amended section 2923.126 ORC to no longer include licensed child care programs in the list of the places concealed handguns are prohibited. This includes centers and family child care programs. The bill does allow child care program owners to choose to prohibit all weapons, including concealed handguns. The bill did not change the requirement for all programs to display the sign pursuant to section 2923.1212.
Child Care Centers:
Each of the following groups will be permitted to have the following weapons in a child care center, unless specifically not permitted by the child care center owner. Although permitted to be in the program, the weapons must not be accessible to children.
1. Handguns may be carried by an individual with a valid concealed handgun license and must be kept out of sight of the children.
2. Weapons may be carried by an active duty member of the U.S. armed forces if also carrying valid military identification and documentation of successful completion of firearms training that meets or exceeds the training requirements described in division (G)(1) of section 2923.125 ORC.
3. Weapons may be carried by a law enforcement official who can document that his or her jurisdiction requires ready and immediate access to the weapon.
Family Child Care Providers:
Each of the following groups will be permitted to have the following weapons unsecured in a family child care home, unless specifically not permitted by the family child care program owner. Although permitted to be in the home, the weapons must not be accessible to children.
1. Handguns may be carried by an individual with a valid concealed handgun license and must be kept out of sight of the children.
2. Weapons may be carried by an active duty member of the U.S. armed forces if also carrying valid military identification and documentation of successful completion of firearms training that meets or exceeds the training requirements described in division (G)(1) of section 2923.125 ORC.

Cynthia C. Dungey, Director
Rehabilitation Criteria for Child Care Centers
The child care licensing rules that were effective December 31, 2016 included updated rehabilitation criteria for prohibitive offenses. This criteria was updated to meet new federal requirements for criminal records checks. The amended rules also require anyone with a criminal records check indicating a prohibitive offense who met the previous rehabilitation criteria be reviewed by April 1, 2017 to ensure the individual meets the new rehabilitation criteria. The rule did not include the specific email address to use to submit documentation for center owners and administrators.
Child Care Staff Members and Employees:
If a child care staff member or employee was employed prior to December 31, 2016, and previously met the rehabilitation standards, the following steps shall be followed:
(1) The owner or administrator shall review the criminal records checks that had previously been reviewed to determine if the individual meets the current rehabilitation standards, detailed in appendix A to OAC 5101:2-12-09 and shall have the individual complete a new JFS 01206 “Rehabilitation Criteria for Child Care” (rev. 12/2016) by April 1, 2017.
(2) If the individual does not meet the updated rehabilitation standards, the administrator shall terminate the individual's employment immediately.
Administrator:
If an administrator was approved by ODJFS prior to December 31, 2016, and previously met the rehabilitation standards, the following steps shall be followed:
(1) The administrator shall submit a new JFS 01206 “Rehabilitation Criteria for Child Care” (rev. 12/2016) and any applicable documentation to ODJFS via email to CCBackgroundCheck@jfs.ohio.gov for review by April 1, 2017.
(2) If ODJFS reviews the administrator’s JFS 01206 and it is determined that the administrator does not meet the updated rehabilitation standards, the program owner shall immediately terminate the administrator’s employment.
Owner:
If an owner was approved by ODJFS prior to the effective date of the rule, December 31, 2016, and previously met the rehabilitation standards, the following steps shall be followed:
(1) The owner shall submit a new JFS 01206 “Rehabilitation Criteria for Child Care” (rev. 12/2016) and any applicable documentation to ODJFS via email to CCBackgroundCheck@jfs.ohio.gov for review by April 1, 2017.
(2) If ODJFS reviews the owner’s JFS 01206 and it is determined that the owner does not meet the updated rehabilitation standards, ODJFS shall propose revocation of the program’s license pursuant to rule 5101:2-12-05 of the Ohio Administrative Code.

Cynthia C. Dungey, Director
Updated Process for Child Care Centers
Chapter 5101:2-12 rules and forms were effective December 31, 2016, however, the Ohio Child Licensing and Quality System (OCLQS) was not available for use at that time. Child Care Center Manual Procedure Letter (CCCMPL) 13 was issued to describe temporary procedures until the system was live.
Updated Process:
OCLQS went live on January 30, 2017. This system shall be used in accordance with rule unless otherwise noted below. The updated information in this procedure letter replaces CCCMPL 13.
Pre-licensing Training
Because of an issue with the tool that feeds the training to the Ohio Professional Registry (OPR), the pre- licensing training is not yet available in the OPR. This, paired with provider feedback, has led ODJFS to review the issue and create an alternative process for the pre-licensing training requirement to be met. Beginning February 24, 2017, the pre-licensing training will be available on the ODJFS website at: http://jfs.ohio.gov/cdc/openingachildcareprogram.stm. Full instructions for the training will also be available there. Once the training is complete, applicants will follow the directions on the website, and at the end of the training, to print and submit documentation of completion to prelicensing@jfs.ohio.gov along with the OPIN number associated with their OPR profile. ODJFS will then document completion of the pre- licensing training in the OPR so that the applicant is able to begin the application process in OCLQS. This process will continue until the training tool issues are resolved and the pre-licensing training is available in the OPR.
Application Process
If a paper application was submitted during the OCLQS transition process, the center now has until Friday, March 3, 2017 to enter the information and applicable payment into the system. If an application is not submitted in OCLQS by the deadline, the ODJFS will close the application and stop processing it for licensure.
New Staff Orientation
Until the training is available in the OPR, the staff orientation is temporarily available on the ODJFS website at http://jfs.ohio.gov/cdc/Licensing_Training.stm. Completion of the training should be documented on the JFS 01307 "Professional Development Documentation for Child Care" and kept on file at the program. The administrator shall sign at the bottom of the JFS 01307 to attest that the child care staff member completed the training. Any child care staff member hired between December 31, 2016 and January 13, 2017 will have until March 3, 2017 to complete the training. Existing child care staff must take this orientation by June 30, 2017 because it has been updated to include information required by new federal child care training requirements.
ODJFS Prescribed Child Abuse Overview
Until the training is available in the OPR, the one-hour child abuse overview training is temporarily available on the ODJFS website at http://jfs.ohio.gov/cdc/Licensing_Training.stm .

Temporary Procedures for Child Care Centers
The Office of Family Assistance has completed a thorough review and restructuring of all child care licensing rules. All licensing rules have been reviewed to ensure that the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services (ODJFS) is mandating only essential health, safety and administration requirements and not requirements that could inhibit small business in Ohio. The rules for all settings have been aligned, renumbered and updated to require the use of the Ohio Child Licensing and Quality System (OCLQS) currently in development.
Temporary Process:
Chapter 5101:2-12 rules and forms are effective December 31, 2016, however, OCLQS will not be available for use at that time. The requirements listed below in this procedure letter will be effective beginning December 31, 2016 until OCLQS is operating.
Pre-licensing Training
The pre-licensing training is currently being offered in person monthly until the online training is available via the Ohio Professional Registry (OPR). The trainings will take place in each ODJFS regional office. Applicants may register via the OPR.
Application Process
A paper application may be used to begin the licensing process and will be accepted without payment. To obtain a fillable paper application, the applicant shall call the Child Care Policy Helpdesk at 1-877-302-2347, option 4. The applicant will then return just the completed application (no attachments or supporting documentation) to CentralOffice_CCPackets@jfs.ohio.gov. The ODJFS will begin the licensing process once the paper application is received. Once OCLQS is operating, any applicant who submitted a paper application shall submit a new application and payment in the system within thirty days of the go-live date.
Licensing Amendments
Licensed child care centers will continue to submit amendments in the Central Office License Tracking System – System for Online License Applications and Renewals (COLTS – SOLAR) system.
Serious Incidents
If a serious incident occurs, the child care center will continue to call the Child Care Policy Helpdesk at 1-877-302-2347, option 4, to report the incident.
Corrective Action Plan (CAP)
The child care center will continue to email the CAP directly to the child care licensing specialist (CCLS). Centers will not be required to enter a CAP into OCLQS for inspections completed prior to OCLQS going live, but may receive a system generated notification due to data entry and conversion. State staff will enter all CAPs submitted between December 31, 2016 and go-live.

Ohio Administrative Code rules 5101:2-12-07 and 5101:2-13-07 outline the process for child care centers and Type A Homes to request a review if there is a disagreement with a licensing finding. The requirement states if the administrator or designee disagrees with a finding and an informal discussion with the licensing specialist does not provide a resolution, the administrator or designee can submit a written request for review to the licensing supervisor within seven days from the receipt of the licensing report. If the center or Type A Home administrator or designee disagrees with the decision of the licensing supervisor, a written request can be submitted to the chief of the licensing section, whose decision is final.
Currently, Type B Home rules do not include a process for owners/administrators to request a review of a licensing finding.
New Request for Review Protocol:
Effective December 31, 2016, Ohio Administrative Code rules 5101:2-12-03 and 5101:2-13-03 will outline the requirements for centers and family child care providers (Type A Homes and Type B Homes) to submit a request for review of a licensing finding. Moving forward, if the center or family child care provider disagrees with a licensing finding and an informal discussion with the licensing specialist does not provide a resolution, the owner/administrator may request a review of the finding by following the steps below:
(1) Complete the licensing section of the JFS 01155 “Request for Review for Licensing and Step Up To Quality” (12/2016)
(2) Submit the JFS 01155 and any applicable documentation via email to ccreviewrequest@jfs.ohio.gov within seven days from the receipt of the finding.
Each JFS 01155 received will be reviewed by a committee comprised of members from the Office of Family Assistance. The committee members will provide a written decision to the center owner or administrator or the family child care provider. The decision of the committee will be final.

Changes to Corrective Action Plans and Revised Inspection Protocol
The Child Care licensing section has modified its inspection protocol and the requirements for all child care
centers submitting corrective action plans.
Background:
Currently, compliance materials are submitted for both regular non-compliances and Serious Risk Non- Compliances (SRNC). This process does not allow child care licensing staff to provide targeted technical assistance as it is cumbersome and time consuming to receive materials for both regular non-compliances and SRNC. Presently, if a program gets any SRNC, it will result in a second inspection to be conducted.
New Corrective Action Plan Policy:
Centers will only be required to submit corrective action plans for SRNC violations and substantiated complaint violations; the submission of a corrective action plan will not be required for regular non- compliances. Child care licensing staff will provide technical assistance at the time of the inspection to address regular non-compliances. The child care website will reflect that these non-compliances were addressed and technical assistance was provided. In the event of repetitive regular non-compliances, a corrective action plan may be required.
New Inspection Protocol:
Full time centers will receive at least one full inspection during the fiscal year. If more than two SRNC are cited during the first inspection, a second inspection will be conducted prior to the end of the fiscal year.

Revisions to the Child Care Center Administrator Qualifications
Amended Substitute Senate Bill 316 of the 129th General Assembly updated the qualifications for child care center administrators. The administrator qualification rule (5101:2-12-24) will be amended to reflect this change, but will not be finalized in rule until January 2015. Effective the date of this letter, child care licensing specialists will assess compliance according to the new requirements in Section 5104.031 of the Ohio Revised Code (ORC).
Background:
Changes to ORC 5104.031 were made to streamline the language and requirements for administrator qualifications. The changes are as follows:
ORC 5104.031 (A)(2)(h) "an infant and toddler or early childhood credential from a program accredited by the Montessori accreditation council for teach education" was added back into statute as it was inadvertently removed.
Ohio Administrative Code (OAC) 5101:2-12-24 (C)(5) "promoted one time to administrator" is no longer in statute and no longer a requirement.
New Policy:
The qualification requirements that will be assessed for administrators, as set forth in 5104.031 of the ORC, are as follows:
(A) A child day-care center administrator shall show the director of job and family services both of the following:
(1) Evidence of at least high school graduation or certification of high school equivalency by the state board of education or the appropriate agency of another state;
(2) Evidence of having at least one of the following:
(a) An associate, bachelor's, master's, doctoral, or other postgraduate degree in child development or early childhood education, or in a related field approved by the director, from an accredited college, university, or technical college;
(b) A license designated as appropriate for teaching in an associate teaching position in a preschool setting issued by the state board of education pursuant to section 3319.22 of the ORC;
(c) Designation under the career pathways model as an early childhood professional level three;
(d) Two years of experience working as a child-care staff member in a licensed child care program, designation under the career pathways model as an early childhood professional level one, and, not later than one year after being named as administrator, designation under the career pathways model as an early childhood professional level two;
(e) Two years of experience working as a child-care staff member in a licensed child care program and, except as provided in division (B) of this section, at least four courses in child development or early childhood education from an accredited college, university, or technical college;
(f) Two years of experience working as a child-care staff member in a licensed child care program and a current child development associate credential issued by the council for professional recognition;
(g) Two years of training, including at least four courses in child development or early childhood education from an accredited college, university, or technical college;
 
(h) An infant and toddler or early childhood credential from a program accredited by the Montessori accreditation council for teacher education.
(B) A person who has two years of experience working as a child-care staff member in a child day-care center and is promoted to or designated as administrator of that center shall have one year from the date of the promotion or designation to complete the courses required by division (A)(2)(e) of this section.
Please Note: Statute incorrectly references (A)(1)(e). Licensing specialists will assess in accordance with (A)(2)(e) as stated above.
In addition to the requirements listed in paragraph (A)(2), an administrator may also get a credential as approved by the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services.
Currently the only ODJFS approved administrator credential is the "Ohio Administrator Credential" administered by the Ohio Professional Registry. Information on this credential is available at https://login.occrra.org.
Please contact the Office of Family Assistance, Child Care Policy Help Desk at 1-877-302-2347, option 4, or your licensing specialist if you have questions regarding this amended administrator qualifications policy.

Revisions to the Child Care Center Crib Requirements
Effective immediately, full size cribs are no longer required. The rules addressing crib requirements for child care centers will be revised to reflect this change. However, as many programs are currently replacing their older cribs with new cribs that meet the new federal standards, the department wanted programs to be notified as soon as possible. Until the rule changes are finalized, during licensing inspection visits, child care centers will be assessed according to the revised requirements contained in this letter.
The revised rule language will state that cribs must be used according to manufacturer's instructions and to discontinue the use of the porta crib when the child is able to climb out or reaches the height of thirty-five inches. Current rule language requiring the program to have a combination of porta cribs and full size cribs shall be removed. Current language regarding infants being able to be placed on a cot at sixteen months with parental permission and language regarding infants who are over thirty-five inches tall shall stay the same.

New Inspection Schedule and Continuous License for Child Care Centers and Type A Homes
Am. Sub. H.B. 153 of the 129th General Assembly made changes to the Ohio Revised Code that require revisions to child care licensing inspection procedures and the implementation of a new "Continuous License" concept. The department's goals are to shift resources to focus on new businesses and those programs experiencing challenges with maintaining licensing compliance, eliminate administrative burdens for the department and providers and to strengthen the revocation process. This letter defines Continuous License, the inspection schedule for all licensed child care centers and type A homes and the time line for implementation.
What is a Continuous License?
Child care programs in Ohio have historically been issued biennial licenses that required programs to apply to have their licenses renewed every two years. This involved completing the renewal application and submitting the renewal fee. With a Continuous License, child care centers and type A homes will be issued licenses that do not have an expiration date. A license will now be valid with no expiration date, unless the program requests to close and terminate the license or ODJFS revokes the license. Due to the elimination of the license expiration date, there will no longer be a two-year licensing period upon which to base the required inspection schedule and programs will no longer need to apply to renew licenses or pay renewal fees.
License Inspection Schedule
Current:
The license inspection period is a two-year period beginning at the initial license issuance date and extending two years. All full-time programs receive two inspections during each year of the license period, while part- time programs receive one inspection during each year of the license period. The provisional period is a six- month period which begins with the initial license issuance date and during this provisional period one inspection is completed.
Under the New Continuous License:
During the new license inspection period, a full time child care center or type A home will receive at least two unannounced licensing inspections in the 12-month license inspection period. However, a full-time child care center or type A home that meets the following criteria will receive one unannounced licensing inspection:
• The program is a Step Up to Quality (SUTQ) Star Rated program.
• The program has been Star Rated for at least 12 months.
• The program has not had its Star Rating suspended or removed during the previous 12-month period.
Provisional License: Effective September 29, 2011 the Provisional License will be issued for a 12-month period. During the Provisional License, a full-time program will have at least three unannounced inspections and a part-time program will have at least two unannounced inspections during the 12 months of the license provisional period.
The chart below provides a comparison between the current inspection schedule and the new Continuous License schedule.

  Current Schedule
      New Schedule
    Provisional License: At least one inspection during six-month provisional period (at approximately day 90).
  Provisional License: Full-time programs will have at least three unannounced inspections during 12-month provisional period.
Part-time programs will have at least two unannounced inspections during 12-month provisional period.
    Regular two-year license, full-time: At least two inspections each year, at least one unannounced and one may be focused.
       Continuous License, full-time: At least two unannounced inspections each year, and one may be focused.
     Regular two-year license part-time: At least one unannounced inspection each year.
    Continuous License, part-time: At least one full unannounced inspection each year and may be focused every other year.
     Regular two-year license with Star Rating* Full-time program: At least two inspections each year, at least one unannounced and one may be focused.
Part-time programs: At least one inspection each year and may be focused every other year.
      Continuous License with Star Rating* Full-time programs: At least one full
unannounced inspection each year.
Part-time programs: At least one full unannounced inspection each year and may be focused every other year.
      *Step Up to Quality initial Star Rating must have been awarded at least 12 months prior and the rating must not have been suspended or removed during the previous 12 months. These programs will continue to receive annual SUTQ verification visits from the SUTQ licensing specialists.
All licensed child care centers and type A homes were evaluated to determine the minimum number of inspections needed for the new license inspection period based on the above criteria. Each program is scheduled to receive the inspections as shown in the chart above. If a SUTQ program has its Star Rating suspended or removed, that program will receive a second visit.

E-mail Address Requirement for Licensed Child Care Centers and Type A Homes
This letter is to notify child care centers and type A home providers that effective December 1, 2010 all licensed child care programs will be required to have and maintain a current e-mail address. This new requirement is a result of the department's development of an automated system for processing initial and renewal license applications. E-mail access between providers and the department will also allow faster, easier and more effective communication regarding changes to licensing policy, rules and forms with less cost associated with the notifications.
Programs should remember the following points when utilizing an email address:
• As of January 1, 2011 all license renewal applications and fire inspection notices will only be sent electronically. Programs will no longer receive paper copies of the renewal application or fire inspection notices. For this reason, the department must have a current, valid program e- mail address on file for every licensed provider. Each program should obtain an e-mail address that the department will use as the program's official contact address. This email address will be treated as a public record. Programs are encouraged to not use the administrator's or any staff member's personal e-mail. Use of an e-mail address belonging to an administrator or a staff member who then leaves the program could result in the program no longer receiving notices, which could affect the program's ability to maintain a license.
• No later than December 1, 2010 all licensed programs must enter the Central Office License Tracking System - System for Online License Applications and Renewals (COLTS - SOLAR) and set up a user account. The only information needed to set up the account is your name and your child care program's e-mail address. Follow these steps to create your account.
1. Go to http://colts-solar.ohio.gov in your browser
2. On the Access page, create a user account by selecting the Create Account button
3. Enter the required information (first name, last name, e-mail address) and create a Key (the Key is needed to access the system. The Key serves the same purpose as a password)
4. Select the Create Account button
5. Your Confirmation #, Key and activation instructions will be sent to the e-mail address you
provided when you created your account
6. Open the e-mail and follow the instructions to activate your account
7. Once you have activated your account you are finished.
• After January 1, 2011, when the system is live, you will be able to access your application(s) online and update your program e-mail address on the application(s), if needed. Until then, if your program e-mail address changes you will need to notify your licensing specialist to change the information.
• Programs that have already submitted an e-mail address via a mailed application or through their licensing specialist must also create an account in COLTS-SOLAR. The program should be sure that the e-mail address on file matches the e-mail address used to create the account. If
 
the e-mail address on file does not match exactly, please notify your licensing specialist so the change can be made in the licensing system. This will prevent conflicting information from being entered into the licensing system records.
• Programs that have already submitted an application through the COLTS-SOLAR should verify that the e-mail address entered on the application under the "Facility Information" section is the program e-mail address and not a personal email address of the administrator or a staff member. If a change needs to be made, please contact your licensing specialist.
If you have questions, please contact the Help Desk for the Office of Families and Children at 1-866-886- 3537, option 4.

Licensed child care centers and licensed type A homes are required to contact verbally ODJFS within twenty- four hours after a serious incident and to follow with a written JFS 01299 within three business days of the serious incident. Certified type B homes are required to verbally contact the County Department of Job and Family Services (CDJFS) within twenty-four hours after a serious incident and to follow with a written JFS 01299 within three business days of the serious incident. When using the electronic submission, the written notification requirement is met. The serious incident data is retained in a database that will be accessible by ODJFS and CDJFS staff.
Beginning May 15, 2009, providers may electronically submit serious incidents to the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services (ODJFS) by accessing the form at: http://www.odjfs.state.oh.us/forms/findform.asp?formnum=01299 on the Forms Central website and submitting the PDF version of the form. Providers will need to have adobe acrobat version 7.0 to utilize this feature. Submission of serious reports via this system does not fulfill the 24 hour requirement to make contact with the designated person at ODJFS or the CDJFS.
As a reminder only serious incidents (as defined in rule) are to be submitted to ODJFS.
Please contact the Help Desk for the Office for Children and Families at 1-866-886-3537, option # 4 if you have any questions.
