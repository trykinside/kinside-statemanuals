FCCMPL 16 (County Agency Serious Incident/Injury Reporting and Assessment)
Family Child Care Manual Procedure Letter No. 16
July 3, 2019 All Family Child Care Manual Holders
Kimberly Hall, Director
County Agency Serious Incident/Injury Reporting and Assessment
Rule 5101:2-13-03 of the Administrative Code requires family child care providers to notify the county agency in the Ohio Child Licensing Quality System (OCLQS) when a Serious Risk Non-Compliance (SRNC) occurs. Until now, county agencies have been able to set their own policies on how to utilize this information once submitted. This new procedure will help ensure consistent use of inspection type in an inspection report for the citation of non-compliances.
Updated Process:
Effective the date of this letter, the following procedures are to be used by county agencies, which are aligned with the state for centers:
• If the information submitted is determined to be a serious incident or injury as defined by rule 5101:2-13- 16 of the Administrative Code, the County Agency Reviewer:
• Contacts the program within three business days, or sooner if instructed by the County Agency Approver, to obtain the details of the incident.
• If the serious incident is not a SRNC or a child fatality the case is closed, and no report is generated.
• If the serious incident report is of a child fatality, regardless of whether it is a SRNC, a serious incident/injury/illness inspection report must be created from the Serious Incident case in OCLQS.
• If the information submitted is determined to be a six-point SRNC as defined by rule 5101:2-13-03 of the Administrative Code, the County Agency Reviewer:
• Notifies the appropriate region email box if the program is currently SUTQ rated.
• If a complaint case is not received within 10 days, a serious incident/injury/illness inspection
report must be created from the Serious Incident case in OCLQS with a corrective action date.
• If a complaint on the same issue is also received, the County Agency Reviewer conducts an
onsite complaint inspection to investigate the allegations reported.
• If a complaint is received after the serious incident/injury/illness inspection report is created, the
serious incident/injury/illness inspection report must be deleted so there is only one inspection report associated with the incident.
• The County Agency Reviewer must contact the County Agency Approver within 24 hours of the notification of the Serious Incident case if the reported serious incident includes the suspicion of child abuse or neglect, a child fatality, or if there is known media involvement.
• If the Serious Incident case that is reported is the result of a suspicion of child abuse or neglect, the County Agency Reviewer must also contact the Public Children Services Agency (PCSA) within 24 hours of the notification.
If you have questions, please contact the Child Care Policy Help Desk at 1-877-302-2347, option 4 or CHILDCAREPOLICY@jfs.ohio.gov.

There is now enhanced functionality in the Ohio Professional Registry (OPR) which allows the JFS 01175 to be submitted electronically. Individuals may now use the OPR to send the JFS 01175 to the ODJFS. For those sent electronically, the JFS 01176 "Program Notification of Background Check Review for Child Care" will be available to the program electronically in the OPR.
Beginning September 2019, all JFS 01175s shall be submitted via the OPR. Programs cannot create accounts and submit or sign the JFS 01175 on behalf of staff, employees or residents. Profiles in the OPR must be owned and controlled by the individual staff, employee or resident. Also in September 2019, programs will be required to link employees and residents to their program in the OPR and keep all individuals currently employed by the program or currently residing in the home linked to the program. Programs should begin this process now to ensure compliance by next fall.

TO: FROM: SUBJECT:
January 19, 2018 All Family Child Care Manual Holders
Cynthia C. Dungey, Director
Requesting to be an Approved Training Organization for Communicable Disease for Child Care Programs
Background:
This letter is to provide notification of the process to become an approved training organization as set forth in rules 5101:2-12-10, 5101:2-13-10 and 5101:2-14-03 of the Administrative Code. The process allows for training organizations to be considered as "an ODJFS approved health organization," which allows the training conducted by these organizations to fulfill the requirements set forth in rule. Currently, an individual trainer must be one of the following:
• Licensed Registered Nurse;
• Physician; or
• Authorized communicable disease trainer for an Ohio Department of Job and Family Services
(ODJFS) approved health organization.
Updated Approval Process:
ODJFS has clarified the procedure outlined in rule for organizations wishing to be recognized as an ODJFS approved health organization to provide the ODJFS/Ohio Department of Health (ODH) approved communicable disease curriculum used by child care programs.
In order for an organization to be recognized as an ODJFS approved health organization for communicable disease training, the organization must submit the following information to ODJFS at CCDTrainer- Registration@jfs.ohio.gov:
• Name
• Contact information (address, phone number, fax number and email address)
• Company website
The organization must provide proof of all the following information:
• The organization currently provides communicable disease training to other agencies;
• A licensed nurse (RN) or physician is employed by the organization and is responsible for oversight of individuals who will be responsible for conducting the communicable disease
training; and
• Staff within the organization have been trained on communicable disease prevention either
through higher education coursework or through training offered within the organization.
Once all the required documents have been received, the ODJFS child care program office will review the information and inform the agency as to whether or not the agency has been approved to be recognized as an ODJFS approved health organization and will be added to the “At-a-Glance Training Chart” located on the website here http://jfs.ohio.gov/cdc/docs/TrainingChartCPR2017.stm. Health organizations that are already approved do not need to reapply.
An individual requesting to be an approved communicable disease trainer must submit the JFS 01278 “Communicable Disease Trainer Registration for Child Care” and one of the following:
• Proof of being a registered nurse or a licensed physician as outlined on the form;
• Proof of being an employee of an ODJFS approved health organization; or
• American Red Cross (ARC) Communicable Disease instructor card
 
• Note: Although ARC is no longer conducting communicable disease training for instructors, if an individual has previously received this card, he or she may still be approved as a communicable disease instructor.
The ODJFS will mail a compact disk with the ODJFS approved communicable disease training to an approved organization or individual.

Cynthia C. Dungey, Director
Expedited Type B License to Provide Kinship Child Care
Section 307.25 (TEMP) by Am. Sub HB 49 of the 132nd General Assembly creates a kinship child care program for families under 200% of the federal poverty level. The program will help families providing kinship care with child care expenses.
New requirements:
Applicants for a Type B Child Care License may request an expedited license in order to serve a child placed by a county public children services agency with a kinship caregiver.
If the applicant provides documentation to ODJFS that a kinship caregiver has selected the applicant as a kinship child care provider and that the child is eligible for the kinship child care program established in Section 307.25 (TEMP) by Am. Sub HB 49 of the 132nd General Assembly, the applicant can apply for an expedited Type B License. The PCSA shall email the following information to TypeBSupervisor@jfs.ohio.gov and BCCLM@jfs.ohio.gov. The email shall have "Type B expedited license for kinship" in the subject line and contain all of the following:
1. The name, address and phone number of the Type B applicant.
2. The name and address of the kinship caregiver.
3. The name and contact information of the PCSA and caseworker involved.
The applicant will follow all of the regulations of Chapter 5104. of the Ohio Revised Code and Chapter 5101:2-13 of the Ohio Administrative Code with the following exceptions:
1. The initial $250 license fee will be waived.
2. The applicant will have to complete both the pre-licensing orientation as required by rule 5101:2- 13-02 of the Administrative Code and the one-hour child abuse overview as required for child care staff members by rule 5101:2-13-10 OAC. The applicant can choose to take the full six- hour child abuse recognition and prevention training prior to licensure instead of the one-hour overview. Both trainings can be found at http://jfs.ohio.gov/cdc/Licensing_Training.stm
3. The applicant will not have to complete the following health and safety trainings required pursuant to paragraph A of rule 5101:2-13-10 OAC prior to being licensed, but will have to complete all of them within 60 days of being licensed:
a. First Aid
b. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)

Requirements for Carbon Monoxide Detectors
Effective December 31, 2016, Ohio Administrative Code (OAC) rules 5101:2-12-12 and 5101:2-13-12 required child care centers and family child care homes to have carbon monoxide (CO) detectors present in the program. At the time, the Ohio Fire Code did not address CO detectors for these settings. Effective December 15, 2017, the Ohio Fire Code will be amended to address the requirement for CO detectors for child care centers and Type A Home providers.
New Policy:
Effective December 15, 2017, the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services (ODJFS) will no longer assess compliance with OAC rules 5101:2-12-12 (B)(4) for centers and 5101:2-13-12 (B)(4) for Type A Homes. Since Type B Home providers are exempt from the Ohio Fire Code requirements and are not inspected by the State Fire Marshal's office, the ODJFS will continue to assess that these providers comply with the rule requirements for CO detectors.
Both rules will be amended to reflect these changes.

FCCMPL 9 (Implementation of New Type B Home Provider Background Check Requirements)
Family Child Care Manual Procedure Letter No. 9
May 24, 2017 All Family Child Care Manual Holders
Cynthia C. Dungey, Director
Implementation of New Type B Home Provider Background Check Requirements
The Child Care Development Block Grant Act (CCDBG) of 2014 requires the following five background checks be completed for each individual who owns, works, applies to work or resides in a family child care home or child care center:
• Bureau of Criminal Investigation (BCI)
• Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)
• National Sex Offender Registry
• State Sex Offender Registry
• Statewide Automated Child Welfare Information System (SACWIS)
The law also requires that all background check results be reviewed by the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services (ODJFS). In addition, individuals will no longer be required to complete new background checks if they change employers within a specified timeframe.
Background check rules are currently being amended to meet the new Federal requirements. ODJFS must review the five checks for all child care providers in Ohio by September 30, 2018. ODJFS is reviewing checks for all currently licensed or certified providers in stages over the next year to ensure compliance with the new checks.
Implementation for Currently Licensed Type B Home Providers
Beginning July 3, 2017, ODJFS will work with county agencies to obtain the copies of the results of the most recent BCI, FBI, and child abuse and neglect (SACWIS) checks on file for all licensed Type B Home providers, residents age eighteen and older, child care staff members, employees, and substitutes. County agencies shall submit these records for Type B providers and required individuals to ODJFS by August 15, 2017. This letter is for notification only, there is no action required from Type B Home providers at this time.
ODJFS will review these records, the state and national sex offender registries and will also request all checks from any states the individual resided in for the previous five years.
Type B Providers and Residents Over 18
Once the review of background check results has been completed for each provider and resident of the Type B Home, ODJFS will notify the person and the county regarding the person's eligibility to own or reside in a family child care (FCC) program. If ODJFS determines that the Type B home provider is not eligible to be a provider or that a resident of the home is not eligible to reside in a licensed Type B Home, the county agency shall recommend revocation of the license unless the provider voluntarily surrenders the license.
Employees and Child Care Staff Members
Once the review of background check results has been completed for each employee or child care staff member (including substitutes) of the Type B Home, ODJFS will notify the person and the Type B Home provider regarding the person's eligibility to work in a FCC program. If ODJFS determines the person is not eligible to work in a FCC program, the Type B Home provider shall immediately terminate their employment, unless the individual requests a review. If the individual requests a review the individual cannot be on-site at the program during the review process.

Implementation of New Weapons Requirements
Current licensing rules prohibit all weapons in child care centers and require family child care providers to keep weapons locked and out of sight of all children. Both centers and family child care providers are required by section 2923.1212 of the Ohio Revised Code (ORC) to display a sign that states "Unless otherwise authorized by law, pursuant to the Ohio Revised Code, no person shall knowingly possess, have under the person's control, convey, or attempt to convey a deadly weapon or dangerous ordnance onto these premises."
New Policy Requirements:
Effective March 21, 2017, Amended Substitute Senate Bill No. 199 of the 131st General Assembly amended section 2923.126 ORC to no longer include licensed child care programs in the list of the places concealed handguns are prohibited. This includes centers and family child care programs. The bill does allow child care program owners to choose to prohibit all weapons, including concealed handguns. The bill did not change the requirement for all programs to display the sign pursuant to section 2923.1212.
Child Care Centers:
Each of the following groups will be permitted to have the following weapons in a child care center, unless specifically not permitted by the child care center owner. Although permitted to be in the program, the weapons must not be accessible to children.
1. Handguns may be carried by an individual with a valid concealed handgun license and must be kept out of sight of the children.
2. Weapons may be carried by an active duty member of the U.S. armed forces if also carrying valid military identification and documentation of successful completion of firearms training that meets or exceeds the training requirements described in division (G)(1) of section 2923.125 ORC.
3. Weapons may be carried by a law enforcement official who can document that his or her jurisdiction requires ready and immediate access to the weapon.
Family Child Care Providers:
Each of the following groups will be permitted to have the following weapons unsecured in a family child care home, unless specifically not permitted by the family child care program owner. Although permitted to be in the home, the weapons must not be accessible to children.
1. Handguns may be carried by an individual with a valid concealed handgun license and must be kept out of sight of the children.
2. Weapons may be carried by an active duty member of the U.S. armed forces if also carrying valid military identification and documentation of successful completion of firearms training that meets or exceeds the training requirements described in division (G)(1) of section 2923.125 ORC.

Updated Process for Family Child Care Providers and County Agencies
Chapter 5101:2-13 rules and forms were effective December 31, 2016, however, the Ohio Child Licensing and Quality System (OCLQS) was not available for use at that time. Family Child Care Manual Procedure Letter (FCCMPL) 2 and FCCMPL 3 were issued to describe temporary procedures until the system was live.
Updated Process:
OCLQS went live on January 30, 2017. This system shall be used in accordance with rule unless otherwise noted below. The updated information in this procedure letter replaces FCCMPL 2 and FCCMPL 3.
Pre-licensing Training
Because of an issue with the tool that feeds the training to the Ohio Professional Registry (OPR), the pre- licensing training is not yet available in the OPR. This, paired with provider feedback, has led ODJFS to review the issue and create an alternative process for the pre-licensing training requirement to be met. Beginning February 24, 2017, the pre-licensing training will be available on the ODJFS website at: http://jfs.ohio.gov/cdc/openingachildcareprogram.stm. Full instructions for the training will also be available there. Once the training is complete, applicants will follow the directions on the website, and at the end of the training, to print and submit documentation of completion to prelicensing@jfs.ohio.gov along with the OPIN number associated with their OPR profile. ODJFS will then document completion of the pre- licensing training in the OPR so that the applicant is able to begin the application process in OCLQS. This process will continue until the training tool issues are resolved and the pre-licensing training is available in the OPR.
If a Type B Home provider application was submitted prior to December 31, 2016 and the application is only missing the pre-licensing training (which replaced both the orientation and the health and safety training required prior to December 31, 2016), the applicant has until Friday, March 31, 2017 to complete the pre- licensing training following the process detailed above. If the training is not completed by March 31, 2017, the application shall be closed. County agencies shall have until June 30, 2016 to approve any applications that were missing the pre-licensing training.
Family Child Care Application Process
If a paper application was submitted during the OCLQS transition process, the family child care provider now has until Friday, March 3, 2017 to enter the information and applicable payment into OCLQS. If an application is not submitted in OCLQS by the deadline, the ODJFS will notify the county agency to close the application and stop processing it for licensure.
New Staff Orientation
Until the training is available in the OPR, the staff orientation is temporarily available on the ODJFS website at http://jfs.ohio.gov/cdc/Licensing_Training.stm. Completion of the training should be documented on the JFS 01307 "Professional Development Documentation for Child Care" and kept on file at the program. The provider shall sign at the bottom of the JFS 01307 to attest that the child care staff member completed the training. Any child care staff member hired between December 31, 2016 and January 13, 2017 will have until March 3, 2017 to complete the training. Existing child care staff must take this orientation by June 30, 2017 because it has been updated to include information required by new federal child care training requirements.

The requirement states if the administrator or designee disagrees with a finding and an informal discussion with the licensing specialist does not provide a resolution, the administrator or designee can submit a written request for review to the licensing supervisor within seven days from the receipt of the licensing report. If the center or Type A Home administrator or designee disagrees with the decision of the licensing supervisor, a written request can be submitted to the chief of the licensing section, whose decision is final.
Currently, Type B Home rules do not include a process for owners/administrators to request a review of a licensing finding.
New Request for Review Protocol:
Effective December 31, 2016, Ohio Administrative Code rules 5101:2-12-03 and 5101:2-13-03 will outline the requirements for centers and family child care providers (Type A Homes and Type B Homes) to submit a request for review of a licensing finding. Moving forward, if the center or family child care provider disagrees with a licensing finding and an informal discussion with the licensing specialist does not provide a resolution, the owner/administrator may request a review of the finding by following the steps below:
(1) Complete the licensing section of the JFS 01155 “Request for Review for Licensing and Step Up To Quality” (12/2016)
(2) Submit the JFS 01155 and any applicable documentation via email to ccreviewrequest@jfs.ohio.gov within seven days from the receipt of the finding.
Each JFS 01155 received will be reviewed by a committee comprised of members from the Office of Family Assistance. The committee members will provide a written decision to the center owner or administrator or the family child care provider. The decision of the committee will be final.

Parental Notification of Intent to Revoke License
Division 5104.04 of the Ohio Revised Code (ORC) gives the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services the authority to revoke the license of a child care provider if the child care provider is in non-compliance with the ORC or Ohio Administrative Code (OAC). To initiate the revocation of a license, ODJFS issues a proposed adjudication order (PAO). This order, based on an on-site inspection report, notifies the provider of the alleged non-compliance with the Ohio Administrative Code and initiates a formal hearing.
Updated Procedure:
If a licensed child care provider is issued a PAO, ODJFS will notify all families for whom the provider provides publicly funded child care services. The letter will place the families on notice of the PAO. Previously the procedure included that the hearing date would be provided. This date is not known at the time the PAO is issued.

Five-Year Rule Review for Licensed Type A Child Care Homes
In accordance with Ohio Revised Code (ORC) Section 119.032, each state agency is required to review its rules a minimum of once every five years. The intent of the law is to ensure that rules are clearly written and that program requirements are accurate, up-to-date and clearly expressed. To the extent possible, unnecessary paperwork will be eliminated and local agencies will be given increased flexibility. The purpose of a rule review is to determine whether a rule should be continued without amendment, be amended or be rescinded, taking into consideration each rule's scope and purpose.
A number of rules related to type A child care were recently reviewed and some changes made. The following revisions will be effective December 1, 2011:

This rule is being revised to reflect that the JFS 01242 Medical/Dental/General Emergency Plan has been updated and to add the requirement that weather emergency drills be practiced monthly March thru September.

Rule Revisions for Licensed Type A Homes
This letter is to notify stakeholders that the five rules listed below have been revised to improve the process for obtaining an initial license and renewing a license. These rules are effective September 29, 2011. The following is a summary of the changes to the rules:
Rule 5101:2-13-18.1 "Transportation/Vehicle Requirements for Licensed Type A Homes" has been amended to clarify the intent of the rule requirements. The rule language has been simplified so it is clearly understood that appropriate child safety restraints must be used in vehicles used to transport children, when the vehicle is required by the United States Department of Transportation to be equipped with seat belts at the time of manufacture. This rule does not require school busses to have seat belts or to use child safety restraints.
Rule 5101:2-13-18.2 "Transportation/Driver Requirements for Licensed Type A Homes" has been amended to simplify the record keeping requirements for contracted drivers who provide services to type A homes. The change to the rule requires the home to have the driver's employer complete a JFS 01266 "Contracted Driver Qualification Statement." This one form replaces the numerous documents contracted drivers currently must provide to the home.
Rule 5101:2-13-25 "Employee and Child Care Staff Member Requirements for Licensed Type A Homes" has been amended as a result of the Five Year Review and to simplify the requirements for information that child care staff are required to have on file at the home. The changes to this rule include removing language requiring employees that have been home schooled to submit a letter from their local board of education or state board of education verifying they have met high school graduation requirements. This rule is also being amended to remove the requirement that child care staff members receive a tuberculosis test as part of the employee medical and to specify when all employees must receive the Pertussis immunization. Additionally, the requirement that each employee provide three references has been removed.
Rule 5101:2-13-26 "Statement of Nonconviction and Criminal Records Check for Licensed Type A Homes" has been amended to clarify which employees of a child care home must have the results of a criminal records check on file at the home. The changes to this rule include clarification that persons providing contracted driving services may have their criminal records checks verified by a written statement from their employer rather than having a copy of the information on file at the child care home.
Rule 5101:2-13-42 "Cribs in Licensed Child Care Programs" has been amended to clarify the requirements for dividers between cribs and to implement the new federal standards for cribs. The changes to the rule include broadening the requirements for what type of material may be used for dividers between cribs and to reflect changes made to federal requirements regarding crib construction standards. The revision date of the JFS 01235 "Sleep Position Waiver" has been updated.
The electronic version of the Child Care Home Manual is located at: http://emanuals.odjfs.state.oh.us/emanuals. The manual contains all rules and transmittal letters that the department has issued to licensed type A homes. A current version of this manual should be accessible and utilized by all administrators in all licensed type A homes.

Emergency/Substitute Caregivers Used as Assistants to Type B Home Providers
This letter transmits a revision to a type B provider certification rule that will allow an approved emergency/substitute caregiver to act as an assistant to a type B home provider. This revision is being made to comply with the collective bargaining agreement between the state of Ohio and AFSCME, Ohio Council 8, AFL-CIO/Child Care Providers Together.
The following is a summary of the rule revision, which is effective July 1, 2011:
Rule 5101:2-14-14: Language has been added to allow a type B provider to use an emergency/substitute caregiver as an assistant in the type B home. The provider shall provide a one-time notice to the county agency prior to using an emergency/substitute caregiver as an assistant and shall notify parents when an emergency/substitute caregiver is used. Use of an assistant does not change the provider's capacity or the provider's payment. The provider must be present in the home at all times when the emergency/substitute caregiver is used as an assistant.
A new form, JFS 01920 "Emergency/Substitute Caregiver Acting as an Assistant in a Type B Child Care Home," has been developed to document a provider's use of an emergency/substitute caregiver as an assistant. This form will be released in a separate manual procedure letter.

Parental Notification of Intent to Revoke License
Division 5104.04 of the Ohio Revised Code (ORC) gives the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services the authority to revoke the license of a child care provider if the child care provider is in non-compliance with the ORC or Ohio Administrative Code (OAC). To initiate the revocation of a license, ODJFS issues a proposed adjudication order (PAO). This order, based on an on-site inspection report, notifies the provider of the alleged non-compliance with the Ohio Administrative Code and initiates a formal hearing.
New Procedure:
Beginning December 1, 2014, if a licensed child care provider is issued a PAO, ODJFS will notify all families for whom the provider provides publicly funded child care services. The letter will place the families on notice of the PAO, the process and the hearing date.

Effective immediately, full size cribs are no longer required. The rules addressing crib requirements for type A homes will be revised to reflect this change. However, as many programs are currently replacing their older cribs with new cribs that meet the new federal standards, the department wanted programs to be notified as soon as possible. Until the rule changes are finalized, during licensing inspection visits type A homes will be assessed according to the revised requirements contained in this letter.
The revised rule language will state that cribs must be used according to the manufacturer's instructions and to discontinue the use of the porta crib when the child is able to climb out or reaches the height of thirty-five inches. Current rule language requiring the program to have a combination of porta cribs and full size cribs shall be removed. Current language regarding infants being able to be placed on a cot at sixteen months with parental permission and language regarding infants who are over thirty-five inches tall shall stay the same.

New Inspection Schedule and Continuous License for Child Care Centers and Type A Homes
Am. Sub. H.B. 153 of the 129th General Assembly made changes to the Ohio Revised Code that require revisions to child care licensing inspection procedures and the implementation of a new "Continuous License" concept. The department's goals are to shift resources to focus on new businesses and those programs experiencing challenges with maintaining licensing compliance, eliminate administrative burdens for the department and providers and to strengthen the revocation process. This letter defines Continuous License, the inspection schedule for all licensed child care centers and type A homes and the time line for implementation.
What is a Continuous License?
Child care programs in Ohio have historically been issued biennial licenses that required programs to apply to have their licenses renewed every two years. This involved completing the renewal application and submitting the renewal fee. With a Continuous License, child care centers and type A homes will be issued licenses that do not have an expiration date. A license will now be valid with no expiration date, unless the program requests to close and terminate the license or ODJFS revokes the license. Due to the elimination of the license expiration date, there will no longer be a two-year licensing period upon which to base the required inspection schedule and programs will no longer need to apply to renew licenses or pay renewal fees.
License Inspection Schedule
Current:
The license inspection period is a two-year period beginning at the initial license issuance date and extending two years. All full-time programs receive two inspections during each year of the license period, while part- time programs receive one inspection during each year of the license period. The provisional period is a six- month period which begins with the initial license issuance date and during this provisional period one inspection is completed.
Under the New Continuous License:
During the new license inspection period, a full time child care center or type A home will receive at least two unannounced licensing inspections in the 12-month license inspection period. However, a full-time child care center or type A home that meets the following criteria will receive one unannounced licensing inspection:
• The program is a Step Up to Quality (SUTQ) Star Rated program.
• The program has been Star Rated for at least 12 months.
• The program has not had its Star Rating suspended or removed during the previous 12-month period.
Provisional License: Effective September 29, 2011 the Provisional License will be issued for a 12-month period. During the Provisional License, a full-time program will have at least three unannounced inspections and a part-time program will have at least two unannounced inspections during the 12 months of the license provisional period.
The chart below provides a comparison between the current inspection schedule and the new Continuous License schedule.

  Current Schedule
      New Schedule
    Provisional License: At least one inspection during six-month provisional period (at approximately day 90).
  Provisional License: Full-time programs will have at least three unannounced inspections during 12-month provisional period.
Part-time programs will have at least two unannounced inspections during 12-month provisional period.
    Regular two-year license, full-time: At least two inspections each year, at least one unannounced and one may be focused.
       Continuous License, full-time: At least two unannounced inspections each year, and one may be focused.
     Regular two-year license part-time: At least one unannounced inspection each year.
    Continuous License, part-time: At least one full unannounced inspection each year and may be focused every other year.
     Regular two-year license with Star Rating* Full-time program: At least two inspections each year, at least one unannounced and one may be focused.
Part-time programs: At least one inspection each year and may be focused every other year.
      Continuous License with Star Rating* Full-time programs: At least one full

E-mail Address Requirement for Licensed Child Care Centers and Type A Homes
This letter is to notify child care centers and type A home providers that effective December 1, 2010 all licensed child care programs will be required to have and maintain a current e-mail address. This new requirement is a result of the department's development of an automated system for processing initial and renewal license applications. E-mail access between providers and the department will also allow faster, easier and more effective communication regarding changes to licensing policy, rules and forms with less cost associated with the notifications.
Programs should remember the following points when utilizing an email address:
• As of January 1, 2011 all license renewal applications and fire inspection notices will only be sent electronically. Programs will no longer receive paper copies of the renewal application or fire inspection notices. For this reason, the department must have a current, valid program e- mail address on file for every licensed provider. Each program should obtain an e-mail address that the department will use as the program's official contact address. This email address will be treated as a public record. Programs are encouraged to not use the administrator's or any staff member's personal e-mail. Use of an e-mail address belonging to an administrator or a staff member who then leaves the program could result in the program no longer receiving notices, which could affect the program's ability to maintain a license.
• No later than December 1, 2010 all licensed programs must enter the Central Office License Tracking System - System for Online License Applications and Renewals (COLTS - SOLAR) and set up a user account. The only information needed to set up the account is your name and your child care program's e-mail address. Follow these steps to create your account.
1. Go to http://colts-solar.ohio.gov in your browser
2. On the Access page, create a user account by selecting the Create Account button
3. Enter the required information (first name, last name, e-mail address) and create a Key (the Key is needed to access the system. The Key serves the same purpose as a password)
4. Select the Create Account button
5. Your Confirmation #, Key and activation instructions will be sent to the e-mail address you
provided when you created your account
6. Open the e-mail and follow the instructions to activate your account
7. Once you have activated your account you are finished.
• After January 1, 2011, when the system is live, you will be able to access your application(s) online and update your program e-mail address on the application(s), if needed. Until then, if your program e-mail address changes you will need to notify your licensing specialist to change the information.
• Programs that have already submitted an e-mail address via a mailed application or through their licensing specialist must also create an account in COLTS-SOLAR. The program should be sure that the e-mail address on file matches the e-mail address used to create the account. If
 
the e-mail address on file does not match exactly, please notify your licensing specialist so the change can be made in the licensing system. This will prevent conflicting information from being entered into the licensing system records.
• Programs that have already submitted an application through the COLTS-SOLAR should verify that the e-mail address entered on the application under the "Facility Information" section is the program e-mail address and not a personal email address of the administrator or a staff member. If a change needs to be made, please contact your licensing specialist.
If you have questions, please contact the Help Desk for the Office of Families and Children at 1-866-886- 3537, option 4.

Collective Bargaining Agreement with Independent Child Care Home Providers
The state of Ohio has entered into a collective bargaining agreement with the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) Ohio Council 8 Independent Child Care Home Providers. This agreement was made pursuant to Executive Order 2008-02S, "Establishing Collective Bargaining for Child Care Home Providers." The Ohio Department of Job and Family Services (ODJFS) will implement the terms of the agreement, including policy changes that affect provider certification requirements and responsibilities of the county departments of job and family services. ODJFS will work in consultation with the State-Union Committee to develop and implement new policies and to provide technical assistance.
Per the agreement, ODJFS will:
• Create a brochure for parents who are considering using subsidized child care.
• Develop a list of items to be included in a parent handbook for type B providers to distribute.
• Develop a curriculum for county certification staff to use, which will include an inspection checklist with a section for the provider to make comments at the end of the inspection. The provider will be given a copy of the form before the inspector leaves the home. A similar form will be used for complaint investigations.
• Create a form that will notify caretakers and providers when a change occurs in the caretaker's eligibility.
• Provide training and technical assistance to county staff regarding the terms of the agreement. Notice of rule changes will be made through the usual Clearance and rule-filing process.
The agreement further stipulates that:
• Each CDJFS will schedule 30 minutes during the health and safety training for type B providers to allow a union representative to distribute materials and provide membership information. ODJFS field office staff will schedule 30 minutes during initial meetings with type A providers for this purpose.
• A provider's participation on the State-Union Committee is an acceptable use of a substitute care provider.
• The term "legal representative," as used in rule 5101:2-14-40 of the Ohio Administrative Code, may include a union representative or steward designated by the child care provider.
• Providers and the union may file grievances as a result of alleged violations of the agreement.
AFSCME Ohio Council 8 is a statewide organization representing all of Ohio's type A and type B home providers. AFSCME has eight regional offices in the following cities: Akron, Athens, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Columbus, Dayton, Toledo and Youngstown. Addresses of these offices and the names of their union representatives can be found in the December 2009 edition of the "Providers Together" newsletter. A link to more information for home child care providers can be found at:

Parental Notification of Intent to Revoke License
Division 5104.04 of the Ohio Revised Code (ORC) gives the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services the authority to revoke the license of a child care provider if the child care provider is in non-compliance with the ORC or Ohio Administrative Code (OAC). To initiate the revocation of a license, ODJFS issues a proposed adjudication order (PAO). This order, based on an on-site inspection report, notifies the provider of the alleged non-compliance with the Ohio Administrative Code and initiates a formal hearing.
New Procedure:
Beginning December 1, 2014, if a licensed child care provider is issued a PAO, ODJFS will notify all families for whom the provider provides publicly funded child care services. The letter will place the families on notice of the PAO, the process and the hearing date.

Changes to Background Check Requirements for Child Care Providers
Currently, background checks required by rules 5101:2-12-26, 5101:2-13-26 and 5101:2-14-11 of the Ohio Administrative Code must be updated every four years. The non-conviction statement is required at application for licensure, certification and employment, and is updated annually.
New Policy:
Effective September 29, 2013, Amended Substitute House Bill 59 of the 130th General Assembly amended Section 5104.013 of the Ohio Revised Code. This section now requires that background checks be updated every five years to align with teacher licensure issued through the Ohio Department of Education. The requirements for the non-conviction statement are not changing.
Implementation:
All background checks dated before September 29, 2009 must be updated every four years from the date the check was completed. Background checks dated on or after September 29, 2009 must be updated every five years from the date the check was completed.
Please contact the Office of Family Assistance, Child Care Policy Help Desk at 1-877-302-2347, option 4, your licensing specialist, or your county department of job and family services if you have questions regarding these changes.

Revisions to the Child Care Type B Homes Crib Requirements
Effective immediately, full size cribs are no longer required. The rules addressing crib requirements for type B homes will be revised to reflect this change. However, as many providers are currently replacing their older cribs with new cribs that meet the new federal standards, the department wanted all providers to be notified as soon as possible. Until the rule changes are finalized, during certification inspection visits type B homes will be assessed according to the revised requirements contained in this letter.
The revised rule language will state that cribs must be used according to manufacturer's instructions and to discontinue the use of the porta crib when the child is able to climb out or reaches the height of thirty-five inches. Current rule language which prohibited infants over thirty inches tall from being placed in a porta crib shall be removed. Current language regarding infants being able to be placed on a cot at sixteen months with parental permission and language regarding infants who are over thirty-five inches tall shall stay the same.
