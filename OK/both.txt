SUPPLEMENT II WHAT IS CHILD ABUSE?
What is the Law? Oklahoma statutes define child abuse as harm or threatened harm to a child's health or welfare by a person responsible for the child. This includes non- accidental physical or mental injury, sexual abuse or neglect (10A O.S. § 1-2-101).
• Physical abuse is non-accidental physical injury to a child.
• Mental injury is an injury to a child's psychological growth and development. It is caused by a chronic pattern of behaviors, such as belittling, humiliating and ridiculing a child.
• Sexual abuse, in general terms, includes any sexual activity between an adult and a child for the purpose of sexually stimulating the adult, the child or others. Sexual abuse may also be committed by a person under the age of 18 when that person is either significantly older than the victim or is in a position of power or control over the child.
• Neglect is the failure of the parent or caretaker to provide a child with basic needs such as food, clothing, shelter, medical care, protection and supervision.
• Threatened harm means a substantial risk of harm to the child. It may include acts or expressions of intent to inflict actual harm presently or in the future.
Who must report? Every person, private citizen or professional, who has reason to believe that a child has been abused, is mandated by law to promptly report suspected abuse. Failure to do so is a misdemeanor. A person making a report in good faith is immune from civil or criminal liability. The name of the reporter is kept confidential.
When to report? A report should be made when there is reasonable cause to believe that a child has been abused or neglected or is in danger of being abused. A report of suspected abuse is a request for an investigation. Investigation of child abuse reports is the responsibility of Child Welfare workers and, when a crime may have been committed, law enforcement officials.
If other incidents of abuse occur after the initial report has been made, another report should be made.
How is abuse reported? A report may be made to the 24-hour statewide Child Abuse and Neglect Hotline, 1-800-522-3511.

SUPPLEMENT III
MINIMUM IMMUNIZATION REQUIREMENTS
Section 411 of Title 10 of the Oklahoma Statutes mandates children attending child care obtain, at the medically appropriate time, the Required Immunization Schedule vaccines.
Law Exemptions
Exemptions from the law are allowed for medical, religious, and personal reasons. Summaries are below, including procedures for obtaining exemptions and exclusions.
Medical. For exemptions based on medical reasons, Oklahoma State Department of Health (OSDH) Form ODH 216A, Certificate of Exemption, must be signed by a licensed physician and state the child's physical condition is such that a particular immunization would endanger the life or health of the child. The parent is responsible for obtaining the signature of the physician.
Religious. For exemptions based on religious reasons, an ODH 216A must be signed by a parent or religious leader or a written statement signed by a parent or religious leader may be attached to the Certificate of Exemption.
Personal. For exemptions based on personal beliefs, an ODH 216A must be signed by a parent and include a brief written statement summarizing his or her objections to immunizations.
Exemption Procedures. Programs willing to enroll an unimmunized child based on an exemption, obtain Form ODH 216A from the OSDH Immunization Service, 1-800-234- 6196. Parents complete the form, obtain the required signatures, and return it to the program. Programs review the form for proper completion and signatures, keep a copy in place of an immunization record, and send a copy to the OSDH Immunization Service for approval.
Exclusion of exempt children during outbreaks. If there is an outbreak of a vaccine- preventable disease, programs may be required to exclude unimmunized children based on exemptions or family emergencies. The exclusion may be a lengthy period of time. The Commissioner of Health makes this decision and the program would be contacted by a representative of the health department. The program is responsible for informing the parent of this possibility at the time the Certificate of Exemption is accepted by the program.
Family Emergencies. This provision applies in rare instances when a true family emergency exists, such as a death in the family. A program may allow a child to enter and remain for up to 30 calendar days, without an immunization record. However, a dated and signed parent statement is required. The record must be provided at the earliest possible opportunity. If at the end of 30 days an up-to-date record has not been provided, the program must exclude the child. No child may receive this waiver more than once.

SUPPLEMENT IV DISASTER PREPAREDNESS
Child care providers must be prepared to respond to a wide variety of emergency situations. It may be evacuating children and taking them to a safe place or protecting them from outside threats by keeping them safe inside the facility. You can make sure your families know what you would do in the event of an emergency. A Disaster Plan is critical and should be in place at all times.
Disaster Plan - some things to consider:
• Identify the type of hazards that could affect your facility (tornado, terrorism, gas leaks, flooding, fire, etc.)
• Develop a step-by-step plan to respond to each situation.
• Ensure that all staff have been trained in how to respond to each situation.
• If evacuation is necessary, know where you will go off the premises (examples
include designated shelter sites such as elementary schools, local community
centers, churches, etc.)
• Know how you will account for each child in a disaster. Including procedures for
2 year olds and younger, children with limited mobility, and children who otherwise may need assistance in an emergency, including a child who is mentally, visually, or hearing impaired.
• If it is safest to remain in the facility, determine how you will communicate the emergency situation with parents and necessary authorities.
Disaster Kit suggestions - keep in a plastic tub or container
• Emergency contact information
• Children's record cards
• First aid kit
• Water and paper cups
• Food (examples: infant formula, animal crackers, saltines, etc.)
• Special items for babies or children with special needs (examples: diapers, baby
wipes, medication)
• Toilet paper, tissues, waterless hand sanitizer
• Flashlight
• Radio - battery operated or NOAA weather radio
• Extra batteries
• Toys, books, games
• Plastic garbage bags

SUPPLEMENT V
CHILD PASSENGER RESTRAINT SYSTEM
Oklahoma Statute
47 O.S. Section 11-1112
(Amended 06-06-17)
A. Every driver, when transporting a child under eight (8) years of age in a motor vehicle operated on the roadways, streets, or highways of this state, shall provide for the
protection of said child by properly using a child passenger restraint system as follows:
1. A child under four (4) years of age shall be properly secured in a child passenger restraint system. Except as provided in subsection G of this section, the child passenger restraint system shall be rear-facing until the child reaches two (2) years of age or until the child reaches the weight or height limit of the rear-facing child passenger restraint system as allowed by the manufacturer of the child passenger restraint system, whichever occurs first; and
2. A child at least four (4) years of age but younger than eight (8) years of age, if not taller than 4 feet 9 inches in height, shall be properly secured in either a child passenger restraint system or child booster seat.
For purposes of this section and Section 11-1113 of this title, "child passenger restraint system" means an infant or child passenger restraint system which meets the federal standards as set by 49 C.F.R., Section 571.213.
B. If a child is eight (8) years of age or is taller than 4 feet 9 inches in height, a seat belt properly secured to the vehicle shall be sufficient to meet the requirements of this section.
C. The provisions of this section shall not apply to:
1. The driver of a school bus, taxicab, moped, motorcycle, or other motor vehicle not required to be equipped with safety belts pursuant to state or federal laws;
2. The driver of an ambulance or emergency vehicle;
3. The driver of a vehicle in which all of the seat belts are in use;
4. The transportation of children who for medical reasons are unable to be placed in such devices, provided there is written documentation from a physician of such medical reason; or
5. The transportation of a child who weighs more than forty (40) pounds and who is being transported in the back seat of a vehicle while wearing only a lap safety belt when the back seat of the vehicle is not equipped with combination lap and shoulder safety belts, or when the combination lap and shoulder safety belts in the back seat are being used by other children who weigh more than forty (40) pounds. Provided, however, for purposes of this paragraph, back seat shall include all seats located behind the front seat of a vehicle operated by a licensed child care facility or church. Provided further,
Family Child Care Homes 62 Effective 1-31-18

SUPPLEMENT V
there shall be a rebuttable presumption that a child has met the weight requirements of this paragraph if at the request of any law enforcement officer, the licensed child care facility or church provides the officer with a written statement verified by the parent or legal guardian that the child weighs more than forty (40) pounds.
D. A violation of the provisions of this section shall be admissible as evidence in any civil action or proceeding for damages unless the plaintiff in such action or proceeding is a child under sixteen (16) years of age.
In any action brought by or on behalf of an infant for personal injuries or wrongful death sustained in a motor vehicle collision, the failure of any person to have the infant properly restrained in accordance with the provisions of this section shall not be used in aggravation or mitigation of damages.
E. A person who is certified as a Child Passenger Safety Technician and who in good faith provides inspection, adjustment, or educational services regarding child passenger restraint systems shall not be liable for civil damages resulting from any act or omission in providing such services, other than acts or omissions constituting gross negligence or willful or wanton misconduct.
F. Any person convicted of violating subsection A of this section shall be punished by a fine of Fifty Dollars ($50.00) and shall pay all court costs thereof. Revenue from such fine shall be apportioned to the Department of Public Safety Restricted Revolving Fund and used by the Oklahoma Highway Safety Office to promote the use of child passenger restraint systems as provided in Section 11-1113 of this title. This fine shall be suspended and the court costs limited to a maximum of Fifteen Dollars ($15.00) in the case of the first offense upon proof of purchase or acquisition by loan of a child passenger restraint system. Provided, the Department of Public Safety shall not assess points to the driving record of any person convicted of a violation of this section.
G. A driver of a vehicle who has been rightfully issued a detachable placard indicating physical disability under the provisions of Section 15-112 of this title or a physically disabled license plate under the provisions of Section 1135.1 or 1135.2 of this title and valid letter of forward-facing exemption issued from the Department of Public Safety shall be permitted to transport a child passenger under four (4) years of age in a forward-facing child passenger restraint system. The placard and forward-facing exemption letter must be present in the vehicle to be in compliance.
Family Child Care Homes 63 Effective 1-31-18

SUPPLEMENT V PASSENGER SAFETY IN OKLAHOMA
Most Frequently Asked Questions
• What is the purpose and intent of the child passenger restraint law?
Car crashes are the number one cause of injury and death to children in Oklahoma. A 45-lb. child in a 30-mph crash will be thrown with a force of 1,350 lbs. Fortunately, child safety seats provide a 45-70 percent reduction in significant injuries, depending on the type of seat that is used (booster seat, convertible seat, infant seat, etc.).
• What are the statistics on death or serious injuries in Oklahoma?
More than 20 children under 6 years of age die each year in motor vehicle crashes, and more than 1,100 children are injured, many permanently. More than 70 percent of children who die are not in a child safety seat.
• What does the law require?
Children under the age of 8 must be transported using a car seat or booster seat.
All children under age 4 must be properly secured in a car seat with an internal harness.
• A 5-point harness is the safest restraint system and should be used as long as possible (until the child exceeds the harness’ weight limit).
Children under age 2 must be properly secured in a rear-facing car seat.
• Rear-facing is the safest way for small children to travel, and they should remain rear-facing until they reach 2 years of age or until they exceed the height or weight limit of the car seat.
• Riding rear-facing with legs bent or against the back of the seat is a safe and comfortable position for children. This position best protects their head, neck and spinal cord in the event of a crash.
Children ages 4-7 must ride in a child passenger restraint system or booster seat unless they are taller than 4’9”.
Family Child Care Homes 64 Effective 1-31-18

SUPPLEMENT V
• Are there exemptions to the law that affect child care facilities?
Exemptions include:
• school buses, over 10,000 lbs., or any vehicle not required by law to be
equipped with seat belts; and
• medical issues prohibiting use of belt or restraint system.
• What about older vehicles that do not have shoulder belts in the back seat? What about the center back seat position, which usually does not include a shoulder belt?
Belt positioning booster seats require the use of a lap/shoulder belt. There are only a few seats that do not. For this reason, an exemption was included in the law. The law “shall not apply to . . . the transportation of a child who weighs more than 40 lbs. and who is being transported in the back seat of a vehicle while wearing only a lap safety belt when the back seat of the vehicle is not equipped with combination lap and shoulder safety belts, or when the combination lap and shoulder safety belts in the back seat are being used by other children who weigh more than 40 lbs.”
While lengthy, the exemption was worded this way in part to prevent a motorist from placing a 4- or 5-year-old child in the center lap belt with no booster seat, with empty lap/shoulder belts on either side. This wording closes that loophole for motorists who would deliberately attempt to skirt the law.
• Are there different types of booster seats?
Booster seats for children over 40 lbs. (about 4 years old) generally fall into two categories: backless boosters and high-back boosters. Both are considered "belt-positioning" boosters, because they help to properly position the lap belt on the child's lap and hip bones, rather than the abdomen.
High-back boosters are recommended for positions in vehicles that do not have head rests (usually older vans and pickup trucks). Both seats achieve the same thing: they boost the child high enough so that the seat belt fits properly.
Both require the use of a lap/shoulder belt.
Family Child Care Homes 65 Effective 1-31-18

SUPPLEMENT V
• What are some important facts to remember considering the transportation of children?
Be sure that any booster seat, car seat or infant seat is used according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Ensure that the type of passenger restraint system is used properly with the type of seat belt system that is installed in your vehicle.
Remember to verify the particular car seat is appropriate for the specific height and weight of the child that is being transported.
• What resources are available to help low-income families obtain booster seats?
Some county health departments distribute free seats, mostly to WIC-eligible clients. SAFE KIDS offers subsidized seats to families who receive public assistance. The cost to the client is $10 per car seat. Car seats are distributed during community car seat events to eligible families on a first-come, first-served basis. Contact Safe Kids for a list of events in your area.

SUPPLEMENT VII SCHOOL-AGE CHILDREN

SUPPLEMENT VIII CHILD GUIDANCE PRINCIPLES
As a caregiver, you have a unique opportunity to positively influence the children in your care. It is important that they learn to handle situations of life in ways that are socially acceptable and personally satisfying. The primary goal of guidance is to help children behave well, not to stop misbehavior.
Below are some general principles of child behavior and guidance:
1. Children need rules. Give children the security of clear, consistent rules. Present rules as directions, not orders or commands.
2. Use a positive approach. Telling a child what not to do does not prepare him for what to do. Translating the Don'ts into Do's shows a child a more acceptable way to act.
Do's
Just look.
Hold the kitten gently.
Don'ts
Don't touch.
Don't squeeze the kitten.
  3. Build feelings of confidence. A feeling of confidence enables a child to try new things, to develop life skills and talents. Encouragement and praise build self-confidence. Belittling and criticism damage self-confidence.
Situation
Child spills a food tray.
Do's Don'ts
"That's hard to do. Next time try "Can't you do anything right?" carrying it this way."
4. Change the environment to change behavior. Look for the cause of the behavior. It may be because of the environment, and a small change will remedy the situation. (If a child spills her milk at every meal, give her a cup with a lid. If children kick each other at lunch, put them at opposite ends of the table.)
5. Give choices. Allow children to have choices when you can accept their decisions. Arrange the choices so that either one is acceptable. This gives the child some freedom and an opportunity for decision-making. (Do you want orange juice or apple juice?)
   Family Child Care Homes 71 Effective 1-31-18

SUPPLEMENT VIII
6. Work with a child instead of against him. Recognize each child's needs in relation to his developmental level. Keep in mind that each child grows and develops in his own time and way. Provide opportunities for learning that are appropriate for that particular child.
7. Teach by example. Children learn by example. As you model positive behaviors, you show children the behaviors you expect of them. (If you want children to speak softly, you speak softly. If you want children to sit quietly, model sitting quietly.)
8. Don't always rush to the rescue. Children need to learn to solve problems. Allow children to work out their own problems whenever possible.
9. Avoid trouble. Remember to guide desirable behavior and avoid trouble before it arises. As you get to know the children, you will be able to predict how they will behave.
10.Recognize and encourage acceptable behavior. If appropriate behaviors are given attention, they are likely to continue. The same is true when inappropriate behaviors are given attention.
11.Guide children with concern and understanding. Show an attitude of affection. Use language that children understand to explain why some behavior is inappropriate and what behavior is appropriate. Redirect the child when behavior is inappropriate.
12.Prepare children for activities. Give clear directions. Provide a range of activities and allow some choice. Help children to feel successful at a task. Allow children to wind down from one activity before beginning another.
13.Use fair and consistent rules. The atmosphere should be relaxed and pleasant. Rules should be easily understood.
14.Use positive discipline. Positive discipline is training that teaches self-control. Your task is to guide children in ways that allow them to control themselves.

SUPPLEMENT IX
AGES AND STAGES OF CHILD DEVELOPMENT
Planned daily activities are important because they provide an opportunity for children to learn and have fun. They also provide structure so children will know what to expect.
A schedule of daily activities should be appropriate to each child's developmental level. Infants and toddlers need to be talked to, held and rocked. School-age children enjoy opportunities for team sports, collecting and table games. All children need to be helped to grow one step at a time at a pace that is comfortable for each of them.
Although each child grows and develops at his or her own rate, there are predictable patterns of child development. Caregivers should be familiar with the developmental patterns of children's growth. Below are some of the ages and stages of development for the typical child.
Infants
• Gain muscle strength and body control;

SAFE FOOD HANDLING RECOMMENDATIONS
1. Handsshouldbewashedwithsoapandrunningafteranycontamination,suchas:after using the bathroom, after changing diapers, after coughing or sneezing, after handling raw meat and after handling pets.
2. Cooking temperatures - beef roasts and steaks - 145°F; poultry - 165°F; ground beef and pork - 160°F. If a thermometer is not available, do not eat ground beef that is still pink inside. A clean thermometer should be used to make sure foods are cooked all the way through.
3. Eggs should be cooked until the yolk and white are firm. Don't use recipes in which eggs remain raw or only partially cooked.
4. Fish should be opaque and flake easily with a fork.
5. Microwave ovens - make sure there are no cold spots in food where bacteria can survive. For best results, cover food, stir and rotate for even cooking, and let stand for 2 minutes after cooking.
6. Refrigerator temperature - set no higher than 41°F. Check these temperatures occasionally by securing an appliance thermometer in the refrigerator where it is visible.
7. Raw meat products, poultry, or fish should be stored below other food in the refrigerator so that it can not drip into any food below.
8. Refrigerate or freeze perishables, prepared foods and leftovers within two hours or sooner. Don't pack the refrigerator; cool air must circulate to keep food safe.
9. Thaw food in the refrigerator, under cold running water or in the microwave. Marinate foods in the refrigerator.
10.Leftovers should be divided into small, shallow containers for quick cooling in the refrigerator.
11.Reheat sauces, soups and gravy to a boil and other leftovers to at least 165°F.
12.Food should come from approved sources; no home-canned food.
13.Cutting boards (plastic or non-porous), dishes, utensils and counter tops should be sanitized after preparing each food item. If possible, use a different cutting board for raw meat products.
14.Paper towels should be used for cleaning surfaces and drying hands.
15.Raw meat, poultry, and seafood should be separated from other foods in the grocery
cart and refrigerator.
16.Cooked food should never be placed on a plate or surface which previously held raw meat, poultry or seafood.
