Notes of Decisions
The Department of Public Welfare’s repeated failure to make timely inspections of day care center which it concealed by issuing provisional certificates based on technical or pretextual deficiencies, then granting retroactive certificates of compliance, enabled the Department to evade scrutiny of operator’s appeal of issuance of provisional certificates of compliance by dismissing operator’s appeal as moot. Musheno v. Department of Public Welfare, 829 A.2d 1228, 1232—1233 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2003). Such conduct by the Department raised important public issues, such as official competency, candor and accountability, which survive mootness. Id. at 1233.

(b) The operator shall submit the request for waiver to the regional office before the facility is inspected for issuance or renewal of a certificate of compli- ance.
(c) An operator may request a waiver of only the regulatory standards in the following sections:
