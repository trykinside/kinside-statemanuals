PREAMBLE
The State Board of Social Service has authority for the following set of standards for centers serving children under the age of 13 who are separated from their parents or guardians during a part of the day. The purposes of the standards are (i) to ensure that the activities, services, and facilities of child day centers are conducive to the well-being and development of children and (ii) to reduce health and safety risks in the caregiving environment.
The Virginia Department of Social Services licenses child day centers and enforces the standards through announced and unannounced visits. Every effort is made to protect the rights of children in care and licensees by enforcing the standards using discretion and judgment. When appropriate, technical experts may be consulted to assure accurate compliance determination with the standards. Child day center operators regulated by these standards may request an exception (allowable variance) for any standard that creates a special hardship unless the standard is required by law or another agency’s regulation. Licensees are encouraged to discuss any concerns about licensing procedures, interpretation and application of standards, or the actions of licensing personnel with the licensing inspector and, if necessary, supervisory personnel at the field or home office level.
The regulation entitled General Procedures and Information for Licensure contains procedures for licensure, allowable variances, problem solving conferences, complaint investigations and sanctions. Please refer to that document for detailed information on these topics.

TITLE 63.2 – CHAPTER 18 FACILITIES AND PROGRAMS October 1, 2002
§ 63.2-1811. Asbestos inspection required for child day centers. The \Commissioner shall not issue a license to any child day center which is located in a building built prior to 1978 until he receives a written statement that the building has been inspected for asbestos, as defined by § 2.2-1162, and in accordance with the regulations for initial asbestos inspections pursuant to the Asbestos Hazard Emergency Response Act, 40 CFR Pt. 763 - Asbestos Containing Materials in Schools. The inspection shall be conducted by personnel competent to identify the presence of asbestos and licensed in Virginia as an asbestos inspector and as an asbestos management planner pursuant to Chapter 5 (§ 54.1-500 et seq.) of Title 54.1. The written statement shall state that either (i) no asbestos was detected or (ii) asbestos was detected and response actions to abate any risk to human health have been completed or (iii) asbestos was detected and response actions to abate any risk to human health have been recommended in accordance with a specified schedule and plan pursuant to applicable state and federal statutes and regulations. The statement shall include identification of any significant hazard areas, the date of the inspection and be signed by the person who inspected for the asbestos. If asbestos was detected, an operations and maintenance plan shall be developed in accordance with the regulations of the Asbestos Hazard Emergency Response Act and the statement shall be signed by the person who prepared the operations and maintenance plan. Any inspection, preparation of an operations and maintenance plan or response action shall be performed by competent personnel who have been licensed in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 5 of Title 54.1.
When asbestos has been detected, the applicant for licensure shall also submit to the Commissioner a written statement that response actions to abate any risk to human health have been or will be initiated in accordance with a specified schedule and plan as recommended by an asbestos management planner licensed in Virginia. This statement shall be signed by the applicant for licensure.
The written statements required by this section shall be submitted for approval to the Commissioner's representative prior to issuance of a license. The provisions of this section shall not apply to child day centers located in buildings required to be inspected pursuant to Article 5 (§ 2.2-1162 et seq.) of Chapter 11 of Title 2.2. (1987, c. 654,
§ 63.1-198.01; 1988, c. 723; 1993, cc. 660, 730, 742; 2002, c. 747.)

ASBESTOS INFORMATION
Section 63.2-1811 of Chapter 18, Code of Virginia requires asbestos inspections in any building built before 1978 in which a licensed child day center will be located. The asbestos inspections and management plans must follow the requirements of the Federal Asbestos Hazard Emergency Response Act (AHERA). The asbestos inspectors must be licensed in Virginia as an asbestos inspector AND as a management planner. Centers must ask for a copy of the inspector/management planner's current licenses.
Before a license to operate a center will be issued, the center must submit to the appropriate licensing office a written statement from the asbestos inspector and management planner that the inspection was done according to the AHERA regulation and a management plan completed, IF asbestos is found or assumed to be present in the building. The center must keep a copy of the complete inspection report, management plan (if applicable) and written statement at the center. Information regarding what the asbestos inspector must include in the written statement is included in this attachment. A suggested form for the written statement is available from the appropriate licensing office. The asbestos inspector/management planner’s written statement must be submitted to the appropriate licensing office.
If asbestos is found or assumed to be present in the building, the law also requires the applicant for center licensure to submit a written statement that the applicant will follow the recommendations of the management plan. A suggested form is available from the appropriate licensing office. The applicant is responsible for carefully reviewing the report and management plan and taking the appropriate actions to minimize the health hazards to occupants of the building.
Licensed child day centers are not required to have the three-year re-inspections required by the AHERA rule. However, if the management plan recommends a re- inspection every three years, the center must comply with that recommendation.
Child day centers located in currently operating public school buildings or state owned buildings are exempt from the requirements of the Department of Social Services’ law. These buildings are subject to other State and Federal laws governing asbestos inspections.
Any public or private, not for profit, school in Virginia with children, who have reached their fifth birthday on or before September 30 of the current school year, will be considered as operating a school as defined under State law. These programs are subject to the AHERA regulation and must receive an asbestos inspection and management plan for the building occupied by the school. For profit schools are not subject to the AHERA law. This means that licensed or exempt child day centers and certified preschools (not for profit) providing care to children who turn five on or before September 30th of the current school year must have an asbestos inspection and management plan following the AHERA guidelines. These reports must be submitted to the Department of Education. If the building was first occupied after October 12, 1988, it may not need to be inspected if the building owner or center administrator has a letter from the architect of the building stating that no asbestos was specified or used in the building. That letter becomes part of the management plan and is also submitted to the Department of Education. The age of the child determines subjectivity to AHERA, not the type of program the center offers. Children who turn five during the school year will not trigger subjectivity to AHERA. In addition, after school
Attachment III
      
child care programs that serve children five years of age or older are not considered schools, and are not subject to AHERA.
Public or private, not for profit, child day centers that have already had an asbestos inspection completed according to the Department of Social Services’ asbestos law should determine if they are also subject to the AHERA regulation for public and private schools. If you have questions regarding your subjectivity to this law, please contact the Department of Education at:
Facilities Services Department of Education James Monroe Building 101 North 14th Street Richmond, Virginia 23219 804-225-2035
REQUIREMENTS FOR WRITTEN STATEMENT FROM ASBESTOS INSPECTOR
The written statement prepared by the licensed asbestos inspector and management planner and submitted to the appropriate licensing office must include:
1. Verification that the building in which the child day center is located was inspected for asbestos according to the requirements of the Asbestos Hazard Emergency Response Act - 40 CFR Part 763 - Asbestos Containing Materials in Schools; and either;
a. no asbestos was detected; or
b. asbestos was detected and response actions to abate any risk to human health have been completed; or
c. asbestos was detected and response actions to abate any risk to human health have been recommended in accordance with a specified schedule and plan pursuant to applicable state and federal statutes and regulations.
2. The date of the inspection.
3. Signature of the licensed asbestos inspector and management planner, including copies of the Virginia licenses.
4. If asbestos is found, or suspect material is found that is assumed to contain asbestos, the statement shall include:
a. The location of any significant hazard areas;
b. Verification of completion of the management plan;
c. Response actions recommended by the inspector; and
d. Verification that response actions have been completed, if applicable.
The complete asbestos inspection report and management plan, including the operations and maintenance plan, must be prepared and submitted to the applicant for licensure by the asbestos inspector/management planner.

CHILD RESTRAINT DEVICES AND SAFETY BELTS FOR TRANSPORTING CHILDREN
(§§ 46.2-1095 – 46.2-1100 of the Code of Virginia) July 1, 2007
§ 46.2-1095. Child restraint devices required when transporting certain children; safety belts for other children less than sixteen years old required; penalty.
A. Any person who drives on the highways of Virginia any motor vehicle manufactured after January 1, 1968, shall ensure that any child, up to age eight, whom he transports therein is provided with and properly secured in a child restraint device of a type which meets the standards adopted by the United States Department of Transportation. Further, rear-facing child restraint devices shall be placed in the back seat of a vehicle. In the event the vehicle does not have a back seat, the child restraint device may be placed in the front passenger seat only if the vehicle is either not equipped with a passenger side airbag or the passenger side airbag has been deactivated.
B. Any person transporting any child less than sixteen years old, except for those required pursuant to subsection A to be secured in a child restraint device, shall ensure that such child is provided with and properly secured by an appropriate safety belt system when driving on the highways of Virginia in any motor vehicle manufactured after January 1, 1968, equipped or required by the provisions of this title to be equipped with a safety belt system, consisting of lap belts, shoulder harnesses, combinations thereof or similar devices.
C. A violation of this section shall not constitute negligence, be considered in mitigation of damages of whatever nature, be admissible in evidence or be the subject of comment by counsel in any action for the recovery of damages in a civil action.
D. A violation of this section may be charged on the uniform traffic summons form.
E. Nothing in this section shall apply to taxicabs, school buses, executive sedans, or limousines.
§ 46.2-1096. Exceptions for certain children.
Whenever any physician licensed to practice medicine in the Commonwealth or any other state determines, through accepted medical procedures, that use of a child restraint system by a particular child would be impractical by reason of the child's weight, physical unfitness, or other medical reason, the child shall be exempt from the provisions of this article. Any person transporting a child so exempted shall carry on his or her person or in the vehicle a signed written statement of the physician identifying the child so exempted and stating the grounds therefor. (1982, c. 634, § 46.1-314.3; 1983, c. 296; 1989, c. 727.)
§ 46.2-1097. Child restraint devices; special fund created.
The Department of Health shall operate a program to promote, purchase, and distribute child restraint devices to applicants who need a child restraint device but are unable to acquire one because of financial inability. A special fund, known as the Child Restraint Device Special Fund, shall fund the program. The Department of Health shall determine the number of child restraint devices that can be purchased by the program, based upon the amount of funds in the Child Restraint Device Special Fund, provided, however, that the requirements of the Virginia Public Procurement Act (§ 2.2-4300 et seq.) shall not apply to child restraint device purchases by the Department of Health pursuant to this
Attachment V

section. The Child Restraint Device Special Fund shall consist of all civil penalties that are collected pursuant to § 46.2-1098 and other funds that may be appropriated for that purpose. (1982, c. 634, § 46.1-314.4; 1984, c. 778; 1986, c. 283; 1989, c. 727; 1996, c. 145.)
§ 46.2-1098. Penalties; violations not negligence per se.
Any person, including those subject to jurisdiction of a juvenile and domestic relations district court, found guilty of violating this article shall be subject to a civil penalty of fifty dollars, which shall not be suspended in whole or in part, for a violation of § 46.2-1095, or, if applicable, a civil penalty of twenty dollars for failure to carry a statement as required by §46.2-1096. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of § 46.2-1095, the court may waive or suspend the imposition of the penalty for a violation of § 46.2-1095 if it finds that the failure of the defendant to comply with the section was due to his financial inability to acquire a child restraint system. All civil penalties collected pursuant to this section shall be paid into the Child Restraint Device Special Fund as provided for in § 46.2-1097.
No assignment of demerit points shall be made under Article 19 (§ 46.2-489 et seq.) of Chapter 3 of this title and no court costs shall be assessed for violation of § 46.2-1095.
Violations of this article shall not constitute negligence per se; nor shall violation of this article constitute a defense to any claim for personal injuries to a child or recovery of medical expenses for injuries sustained in any motor vehicle accident. (1982, c. 634, § 46.1-314.5; 1989, c. 727; 1992, cc. 119, 405; 2002, c. 358.)
§ 46.2-1099. Further exemptions.
This article shall not apply to:
The transporting of any child in a vehicle having an interior design which makes the use of such device impractical; or
The transporting of children by public transportation, bus, school bus, or farm vehicle.
For the purposes of this section, "farm vehicle" means a vehicle which is either (i) exempt from registration pursuant to §§ 46.2-664, 46.2-665, 46.2-666, 46.2-667, 46.2-670, or § 46.2- 672, (ii) registered as a farm vehicle pursuant to § 46.2-698, or (iii) owned by a resident of another state under whose laws the vehicle is either registered as a farm vehicle or exempt from registration by virtue of its use as a farm vehicle. (1982, c. 634, § 46.1-314.6; 1989, c. 727; 1992, cc. 119, 405; 1993, c. 181.)
§ 46.2-1100. Use of standard seat belts permitted for certain children.
The use of a seat belt of the type which is standard equipment shall not violate this article if (i) the affected child is at least four years old but less than eight years old and (ii) any physician licensed to practice medicine in the Commonwealth or any other state determines that use of a child restraint system by a particular child would be impractical by reason of the child's weight, physical fitness, or other medical reason, provided that any person transporting a child so exempted shall carry on his person or in the vehicle a signed written statement of the physician identifying the child so exempted and stating the grounds for the determination. (1982, c. 634, § 46.1-314.7; 1989, c. 727; 2002, cc. 616, 660; 2007)

 How M uch Fall Protection is needed?
For the prevention of l ife-threaicn- ing injuries. the first question thm needs lo be answered is ;'Will
!his surface prov ide adequate foll protection?" The \Jational Program for Playground Safety has de'eloped a safe surface decision-making model to help individuals dctcnnine whether or not a playground surface will meet the criteria or adequate fall protection (See Figure I). A-. can be :,.:en in the model outlined in Figure I .there are four decisions that arc i nvolved in the selection of surfaces tha t will provide adequate fall protection. These include the selection of su itable materials. the height of the equi pment. the depth of the surface materials and ade- quate CO\ crage in the use wne.
Suitable Materials: According to the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC. 1997) there are a number of materials that tend to reduce the risk of life threaten- ing injuries. Acceptable matcriab include sand, gravel, wood chips. engi neered wood fiber.shredd ed rubberandsyntheticsurfaces.
llard materia ls such as aspha lt and concrete arc unacceptable surfaces under playground equipment. Similarly.earthsurfacessuchas
studies indicate that equi pment over >ix feet in heigh t has double the inju ry rate of cquip111cnt under six feel. the NPPS recommends that the height of playground equipment should not exceed eight
feet for school age children and six feet for preschool children.

 How Will Accessibility be Provided?
The second characteristic that needs to be considered in the ;,election of surfacing material 1 that of acces- sibility. According 10 the AmericanswithDisabilitiesAct (ADA) of 1990,discrimination on the basis of disability i11 public accommodationsisprohibited. Thus,all newlyhuil1orsubstantially
alteredpublicplayareasmustmeet accessibility guidelines. While the entire playground area docsn't have to be accessible. there mu;,t be an accessible pathway to accessible playground equipment. Therefore. a pathway made of an accessible surface material must be pro,idcd. At this time. the testing of loose fill materials foraccessibilityisstillin process. However, it i;, well accepted that sand and pea grave l arc not accessible surfoccs.
What are the Maintenance

process. is the maintenance
requirements that various surfaces is usually the dctem1imng factor
precisely, it is 1hc initial cost of purchasing and installing the material that is oflcn the deciding factor for the choice of surface.
While in it ial costs are 1mponan1. other cons1dcrat ions should also be studied. First. the initial cost of the surface should be prorated over the life expectancy of the playground. For instance.asyntheticsurface can be as much as ten ti mes the cost of a l oose fill surfocc. However, synthetic surface will generally lastforatleastrcnyears.whereas most loose !111matcrials will need some replacement on a yearly basis. Thus,annualmaintenance and replacement expcn'e' also need to be factored into the O\ crall costs.
Additionally. the installation costs includingmethodofcontainment,
lruckingcosts.!111dremovingthe existing surface must be considered. Forexample,installationcostscan be as high as 30% of the OYera ll cost of the surfacing. All of these factors contribute to the overall cost of the material to be ;,elected. The point is. that although loose fillsurfacinginitiallylookslikea bargain in compari>on to many synthetic surfaces; in uciuali ty, the realcostmaybeverysimilarwhen all the other costs arc factored into the equation.
The selection of surfacing should be approached in a very methodical and deliberate manner.
