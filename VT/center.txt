Licensing Regulations for Center Based Child Care and Preschool Programs
Effective Date: September 1, 2016
FOREWORD
Child Care Licensing Regulations govern child care facilities and programs in the State of Vermont. These rules are minimum requirements established to protect the health and safety of Vermont’s children in out‐of‐home care and ensure that children in care, early education and afterschool programs in Vermont are provided with wholesome growth and educational experiences.
This is a revision of two sets of regulations: Early Childhood Program Licensing Regulations, (February 2001), and Children’s Day Care Licensing Regulations for Non‐ Recurring Clientele, (October 1996), hereafter combined and known as Center Based Child Care and Preschool Programs. The combined regulations create consistency in basic standards for all center‐based settings and include reasonable accommodations for specific settings such as Non‐Recurring Care Programs and Public School Pre‐kindergarten Programs.
Revisions were developed in an intensive two and a half year process engaging national experts, local stakeholders, care and education providers, and licensing and program quality staff in the Child Development Division (CDD) to produce a comprehensive revision of Vermont’s child care regulations that is child‐centered, family friendly and fair to providers. Representatives from Vermont Department of Health, Vermont Agency of Education, and Vermont Department of Mental Health also advised and participated. All participants agreed on the goal to set clear, consistent, developmentally appropriate standards based on observable program characteristics known to protect and promote the health, safety and well‐being of children in care and education settings.
The development process began by collecting broad input in community forums co‐ convened by the CDD, Building Bright Futures Regional Councils and local Community Child Care Support Agencies in each of the twelve (12) Agency of Human Services regions across the state. Subsequently over one hundred child care providers, child care licensors, and other community stakeholders came together in six (6), geographically dispersed, Saturday morning work groups eleven (11) times over thirteen (13) months to review research on best practice, discuss current practices and realities, and to develop recommendations for revised licensing standards. The State of Vermont is indebted to these highly committed, hardworking volunteers for their well‐informed contribution to this result.
i

Over many months, a team of CDD staff reviewed and compiled work group recommendations into iterative drafts; solicited information about appropriate exceptions needed by Vermont’s licensed Children’s Day Cares’ for Non‐Recurring Clientele and public school operated preschools. In addition, CDD staff met with staff from the Vermont Division of Fire Safety, Vermont Agency of Natural Resources, and Vermont Department of Health to discuss and review the drafted revisions.
Revisions to the rules reflect an understanding of current scientific evidence related to how children learn and develop. The rules also reflect industry standards and realities in implementing child care and early education program practices that impact the health, safety and well‐being of children. The rules incorporate changes in the organization of Vermont state agencies responsible for licensing and monitoring; changes in applicable state and federal legislation and regulations from other related governing entities; the use of information technology in government and program administration; and the evolving system of early childhood and afterschool services in Vermont.
It is the intent of the Department for Children and Families, Child Development Division in the Vermont Agency of Human Services that licensing requirements are clear, reasonable, fair and enforceable and keep children and their families at the center of our concern.
In the interests of serving the public, comments on the rules are welcome at any time and will be considered for future revisions or the development of new requirements. Comments can be made on our website: http://dcf.vermont.gov/cdd/laws‐regs

APPENDIX A
Signs and Symptoms of Illness Chart (Adapted)
The following chart lists, in alphabetic order, some of the most common signs and symptoms that individuals child care settings may develop when they have an infectious disease. Health professionals can use this chart to discuss with caregivers/teachers what they should look for to recognize diseases and make decisions about when individuals need medical care. Caregivers/teachers/program providers should use this information to be aware of what might cause various signs and symptoms, when it is appropriate to notify a health consultant and/or the parent, and the criteria to determine when individuals should be excluded from and can return to a group setting or program. All caregivers/teachers and direct staff should work with health professionals to ensure an appropriate diagnosis and treatment.
Note that the chart indicates when visits to a health professional are necessary. Not all individuals who are excluded from a child care setting require a visit to a health professional prior to return. However, if you are concerned about the nature of the individuals’s specific illness or need instructions about how to care for the individual, the child’s parent/guardian can make a phone call to the child’s health professional to clarify whether further evaluation is necessary. With parent/guardian consent, the child’s health professional can give additional instructions in writing or over the phone to caregivers/teachers.
The Signs and Symptoms Chart is adapted from Managing Infectious Diseases in Child Care and Schools: A Quick Reference Guide, 2nd Edition a publication of the American Academy of Pediatrics. It is printed with permission to be included in the Vermont Child Care Regulations.
