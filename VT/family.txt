Licensing Regulations for Registered and Licensed Family Child Care Homes Effective Date: September 1, 2016
FOREWORD
Child Care Licensing Regulations govern child care facilities and programs in the State of Vermont. These rules are minimum requirements established to protect the health and safety of Vermont’s children in out‐of‐home care and ensure that children in child care programs in Vermont are provided with wholesome growth and educational experiences.
This is a revision of two sets of regulations: Regulations for Family Day Care Homes, (October 1996), and Family Child Care Licensing Regulations, (February 2001), hereafter combined and known as Licensing Regulations for Registered and Licensed Family Child Care Homes. Licensed Family Child Care Homes can provide services for more children and are required to meet some additional standards not required for Registered Family Child Care Homes. The combined regulation creates consistency in basic standards across levels in a family child care home setting and a clear path from one type to another if a provider wants to make that transition.
Revisions were developed in an intensive two and a half year process engaging national experts, local stakeholders, child care and education providers, and licensing and program quality staff in the Child Development Division (CDD) to produce a comprehensive revision of Vermont’s child care regulations that is child‐centered, family friendly and fair to providers. Representatives from Vermont Department of Health, Vermont Agency of Education, and Vermont Department of Mental Health also advised and participated. All participants agreed on the goal to set clear, consistent, developmentally appropriate standards based on observable program characteristics known to protect and promote the health, safety and well‐being of children in care and education settings.
The development process began by collecting broad input in community forums co‐ convened by the CDD, Building Bright Futures Regional Councils and local Community Child Care Support Agencies in each of the twelve (12) Agency of Human Services regions across the state. Subsequently over one hundred child care providers, child care licensors, and other community stakeholders came together in six (6), geographically dispersed, Saturday morning work groups eleven (11) times over thirteen (13) months to review research on best practice, discuss current practices and realities, and to develop recommendations for revised licensing standards. The State of Vermont is indebted to these highly committed, hardworking volunteers for their well‐informed contribution to this result.
i

Over many months, a team of CDD staff reviewed and compiled work group recommendations into iterative drafts, and staff met with staff from the Vermont Division of Fire Safety, Vermont Agency of Natural Resources, and Vermont Department of Health to discuss and review the draft revisions.
Revisions to the rules reflect an understanding of current scientific evidence related to how children learn and develop. The rules also reflect industry standards and realities in implementing child care and early education program practices that impact the health, safety and well‐being of children. They incorporate changes in the organization of Vermont state agencies responsible for licensing and monitoring; changes in applicable legislation and regulations from other related governing entities; the use of information technology in government and program administration; and the evolving system of early childhood and afterschool services in Vermont.
It is the intent of the Department for Children and Families, Child Development Division in the Vermont Agency of Human Services that licensing requirements are clear, reasonable, fair and enforceable and keep children and their families at the center of our concern.
In the interests of serving the public, comments on the rules are welcomed at any time and will be considered for future revisions or the development of new requirements. Comments can be made on our website: http://dcf.vermont.gov/cdd/child_care_licensing

APPENDIX A
Signs and Symptoms of Illness Chart (Adapted)
The following chart lists, in alphabetic order, some of the most common signs and symptoms that individuals child care settings may develop when they have an infectious disease. Health professionals can use this chart to discuss with caregivers/teachers what they should look for to recognize diseases and make decisions about when individuals need medical care. Caregivers/teachers/program providers should use this information to be aware of what might cause various signs and symptoms, when it is appropriate to notify a health consultant and/or the parent, and the criteria to determine when individuals should be excluded from and can return to a group setting or program. All caregivers/teachers and direct staff should work with health professionals to ensure an appropriate diagnosis and treatment.
Note that the chart indicates when visits to a health professional are necessary. Not all individuals who are excluded from a child care setting require a visit to a health professional prior to return. However, if you are concerned about the nature of the individuals’s specific illness or need instructions about how to care for the individual, the child’s parent/guardian can make a phone call to the child’s health professional to clarify whether further evaluation is necessary. With parent/guardian consent, the child’s health professional can give additional instructions in writing or over the phone to caregivers/teachers.
The Signs and Symptoms Chart is adapted from Managing Infectious Diseases in Child Care and Schools: A Quick Reference Guide, 2nd Edition a publication of the American Academy of Pediatrics. It is printed with permission to be included in the Vermont Child Care Regulations.

(pharyngitis)
1. Viral – common cold viruses that cause upper respiratory infections
2. Strep throat
1.Viral: Verbal children will complain of sore throat; younger children may be irritable with decreased appetite and increased drooling (refusal to swallow). May see symptoms associated with upper respiratory illness, such as runny nose, cough, and congestion.
2.Strep throat: Strep infection usually does not result in cough or runny nose. Signs of the body’s fight against infection include red tissue with white patches on sides of throat, at back of tongue (tonsil area), and at back wall of throat. Tonsils may be large, even touching each other. Swollen lymph nodes (sometimes incorrectly called “swollen glands”) occur as body fights off the infection.

APPENDIX B
Consumer Product Safety Commission 16 C.F.R. § 1220 Regarding Cribs
Beginning December 28, 2012, any crib provided by child care facilities and family child care homes must meet new and improved federal safety standards. The new standards take effect for manufacturers, retailers, importers and distributors on June 28, 2011, addressing deadly hazards previously seen with traditional drop-side rails, requiring more durable hardware and parts and mandating more rigorous testing.
What you should know...
         • This is more than a drop side issue. Immobilizing your current crib will not make it compliant.
• You cannot determine compliance by looking at the product.
• The new standards apply to all full-size and non full-size cribs including wood, metal and stackable cribs.
• If you purchase a crib prior to the June 28, 2011 effective date and you are unsure it meets the new federal standard, CPSC recommends that you verify the crib meets the standard by asking for proof.
o Ask the manufacturer, retailer, importer or distributor to show a Certificate of Compliance. The document must:
 Describe the product
 Give name, full mailing address and telephone
number for importer or domestic
manufacturer
 Identify the rule for which it complies (16 CFR
1219 or 1220)
 Give name, full mailing address, email address
and telephone number for the records keeper
and location of testing lab
 Give date and location of manufacture and
testing
o The crib must also have a label attached with the
date of manufacture
What you should do...
• All child care facilities, family child care homes, and places of public accommodation:
o Must prepare to replace their current cribs with
new, compliant cribs before December 28, 2012. o Should not resell, donate or give away a crib that
does not meet the new crib standards.
• Dispose of older, noncompliant cribs in a manner that the cribs cannot be reassembled and used.
• Noncompliant cribs should not be resold through online auction sites or donated to local thrift stores. CPSC recommends disassembling the crib before discarding it.
