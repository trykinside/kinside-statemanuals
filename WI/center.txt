                                    DCF-P-PFS0205 (R. 10/2019)
effective September 30, 2019.

PREFACE
DCF 251
LICENSING RULES FOR GROUP CHILD CARE CENTERS
Effective September 30, 2019.
DCF 251 was approved as an emergency rule effective 9/30/19. It is currently going through a permanent rule review process with an estimated completion date in Spring 2020.
Section 48.65, Stats., requires that persons operating child care centers which provide care and supervision for 4 or more children under age 7 years for less than 24 hours a day be licensed. The statutes also require the Department of Children and Families to establish rules which must be met in order to qualify for a license and which protect and promote the health, safety and welfare of the children in the care of the child care center.
Chapter DCF 251 is the rule governing Group Child Care Centers, which provide care and supervision to 9 or more children for less than 24 hours a day. There are also other rules governing the out-of-home care of children. DCF 250 is the rule for Family Child Care Centers where care and supervision is provided for between 4 and 8 children under age 7. DCF 252 is the rule for day camps which are licensed child care centers that provide an experience in a seasonal program oriented to the out-of-doors for periods of less than 24 hours a day.
Licensing rules should not be confused with certification for public funding of child care providers who care for between 1 and 3 children under age 7.
Clearly, the fact that a child care center is licensed in no way diminishes the responsibility of parents for vigilance in ensuring that their children are receiving care which protects their physical well-being and encourages healthy intellectual and emotional development.
Whenever the rules in this chapter indicate that materials such as an application for licensure, a request for exception to a specific rule or a complaint about a center are to be sent to or requested from the Department, please refer to Appendix A which identifies the appropriate regional licensing office serving the county or tribe in which the center is located.
There is a header on each page that contains the rule cite for the section of the rule beginning on that page. A table of contents and an index are also included in this document as are appendices that contain key statutes related to the child care rules, a copy of DCF 13 (administrative rules governing child care background checks), a list of items needed for a group child care center and other appendices referenced in the rule.
