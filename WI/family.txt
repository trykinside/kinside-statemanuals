LICENSING RULES FOR FAMILY CHILD CARE CENTERS

effective September 30, 2019

PREFACE
DCF 250
LICENSING RULES FOR FAMILY CHILD CARE CENTERS Effective September 30, 2019.
DCF 250 was approved as an emergency rule effective 9/30/19. It is currently going through a permanent rule review process with an estimated completion date in Spring 2020.
Section 48.65, Stats., requires that persons operating child care centers which provide care and supervision for 4 or more children under age 7 years for less than 24 hours a day be licensed. The statutes also require the Department of Children and Families to establish rules which must be met in order to qualify for a license and which protect and promote the health, safety and welfare of the children in the care of the child care center.
Chapter DCF 250 is the rule governing Family Child Care Centers, which provide care and supervision to between 4 and 8 children under age 7 years for less than 24 hours a day. There are also other rules governing the out-of-home care of children. DCF 251 is the rule for Group Child Care Centers where care and supervision is provided for 9 or more children under age 7. DCF 252 is the rule for day camps which are licensed child care centers that provide an experience in a seasonal program oriented to the out-of-doors for periods of less than 24 hours a day.
Licensing rules should not be confused with certification for public funding of child care providers who care for between 1 and 3 children under age 7.
Clearly, the fact that a child care center is licensed in no way diminishes the responsibility of parents for vigilance in ensuring that their children are receiving care which protects their physical well-being and encourages healthy intellectual and emotional development.
Whenever the rules in this chapter indicate that materials such as an application for licensure, a request for exception to a specific rule, or a complaint about a center are to be sent to or requested from the Department, please refer to Appendix A which identifies the appropriate regional licensing office serving the county or tribe in which the center is located.
There is a header on each page that contains the rule cite for the section of the rule beginning on that page. A table of contents and an index are also included in this document as are appendices that contain key statutes related to the child care rules, a copy of DCF 13 (administrative rules governing child care background checks), a list of items needed for a family child care center and other appendices referenced in the rule.

DCF 250.0(11) for the definition of “fit and qualified.” Examples of charges, actions or offenses the Department will consider when making a determination under this paragraph that an act substantially relates to the care of children include but are not limited to the following: abuse or neglect of a child; sexual assault; abuse of a resident of a facility; a crime against life and bodily security; kidnapping; abduction; arson of a building or of property other than a building; robbery; receiving stolen property from a child; a crime against sexual morality, such as enticing a minor for immoral purposes or exposing a minor to harmful materials; and interfering with the custody of a child. This list is illustrative. Other types of offenses may be considered.
(c) The department shall deny or refuse to continue or revoke a license if the applicant or licensee has failed to pay court-ordered payments of child or family support, maintenance, birth expenses, medical expenses or other expenses related to the support of a child or former spouse or for the failure of the applicant or licensee to comply, after appropriate notices, with a subpoena or warrant issued by the department or a county child support agency under s. 59.53(5), Stats., and related to paternity or child support proceedings, as provided in a memorandum of understanding entered into under s. 49.857, Stats. Notwithstanding s. 48.72, Stats., an action taken under this subsection is subject to review only as provided in the memorandum of understanding entered into under s. 49.857, Stats., and not as provided in s. 48.72, Stats.
(d) The department shall deny an application for the issuance or continuation of a license or revoke a license if the department of revenue certifies under s. 73.0301, Stats., that the applicant or licensee is liable for delinquent taxes. An action taken under this subsection is subject to review only as provided under s. 73.0301(5), Stats., and not as provided in s. 48.72, Stats.
(9) EFFECT OF NOTICE TO DENY OR REVOKE A LICENSE.
(a)1. If the department decides under sub. (8) to deny the grant of a license or to revoke a license, the department shall notify the applicant or licensee in writing of its decision and the reasons for that decision.
2. If the department revokes a license, the effective date of the revocation shall be either immediately or 30 days after the date of the department notice in subd. 1., based on the criteria under s. 48.715(4m)(a) and (b), Stats., unless the decision is appealed under sub. (11).
(b) Upon receipt of the notice in par. (a) and during any revocation or denial procedures that may result, a family child care center may not accept for care any child not enrolled and in care as of the date of receipt of the notice without the written approval of the department.
(10) SUMMARY SUSPENSION OF A LICENSE.
(a) Under the authority of s. 227.51(3), Stats., the department shall summarily suspend a license and close a family child care center when the department finds that the public health, safety or welfare requires emergency action and incorporates a finding to that effect into its order. A finding of a requirement for summary suspension of the license may be based on any of the following:
1. Failure of the licensee to provide environmental protections for the children, such as heat, water, electricity or telephone service.

36 WISCONSIN ADMINISTRATIVE CODE
250.11(10)(a)2.
2. The licensee, an employee, a volunteer or any other person in regular contact with the children in care has been convicted of or has a pending charge for a crime against life or bodily security.
3. The licensee, an employee, a volunteer or any other person in regular contact with the children in care has been convicted of a felony, misdemeanor or other offense which substantially relates to the care of children or activities of the center or has a pending charge which substantially relates to the care of children or activities of the center.
4. The licensee, employee, volunteer or any other person in regular contact with the children in care is the subject of a current investigation for alleged child abuse or neglect pursuant to s. 48.981, Stats., or has been determined by a child protective services agency or law enforcement agency to have abused or neglected a child.
5. The licensee or a person under the supervision of the licensee has committed an action or has created a condition relating to the operation or maintenance of the child care center that directly threatens the health, safety or welfare of any child under the care of the licensee.
(b) An order summarily suspending a license and closing a family child care center may be a verbal order by a licensing representative of the department. Within 72 hours after the order takes effect, the department shall either permit the reopening of the center or proceed under subs. (8) or (9) to revoke the license. A preliminary hearing shall be conducted by the department of administration’s division of hearings and appeals, within 10 working days after the date of the initial order to close, on the issue of whether the license shall remain suspended during revocation proceedings.
(11) APPEAL OF DECISION TO DENY OR REVOKE A LICENSE. Any person aggrieved by the department’s decision to deny an initial license or the renewal of a license or to revoke a license may request a hearing on that decision under s. 227.42, Stats. The request for a hearing shall be in writing and submitted to the department of administration’s division of hearings and appeals. The request for a hearing shall be sent to the division of hearings and appeals within 10 days after the date of the notice under sub. (9). A request for a hearing is considered filed upon its receipt by the division of hearings and appeals.
